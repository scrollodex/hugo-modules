            I have been a psychotherapist and couples therapist since 1980 and have
            worked extensively with bisexual, lesbian, transgender, polyamorous and
            bdsm-oriented clients throughout my professional career.  My style is warm,
            open and expressive. In my work as a certified sex therapist my particular
            expertise is in the area of womens sexuality, desire disorders, and phase
            of life issues. I am a sex and relationship advice columnist for national
            magazines and a feature articles contributor.  I am currently working on my
            second book, due out in spring 2003, which focuses on female sexuality. I
            created the "Working with Polyamorous Clients in the Clinical Setting"
            workshop for sexuality professionals  (outline available at
            <A HREF="http:\www.lovethatworks.org">www.lovethatworks.org</A>). I have additional expertise in treatment related to ADD, disorders of mood, and enhancement of the creative process.  The demands of writing mean that my private practice is small and often full, but I urge
            you to inquire about availability. Feel free to make initial inquiries
            via email.

            As a gay and lgbt-affirmative Psychologist, I provide individual,
            group and couples psychotherapy for a variety of clients.  I specialize
            in working with gay and bisexual men and women who are dealing with
            issues of sexual identity confusion, self-esteem, developing a positive
            bisexual and/or lesbian or gay identity; depression and anxiety; marital problems and marital-decision making around sexuality issues; substance abuse and addictions; sexual addiction; and recovering from childhood and/or adult sexual victimization experiences, including covert
            and overt incest, sexual assault and rape. I serve adults from ages 18-70.






            I believe that the sexual orientation of a person is their decision only,
            and it is my desire as a Psychologist to help people to feel comfortable
            and to affirm and celebrate the sexual/emotional/physical and spiritual
            connections they choose to make with the men and women in their lives. I am the Chairperson of the Ohio Psychological Associations Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered Task Force for the past 2 years, since its beginning.

            I have practiced heart-centered, body-centered, psychospiritual therapy for
            nearly two decades in the Boston Area.  I founded the Institute for
            Emotional-Kinesthetic Psychotherapy in 1990.  My interests include trauma
            work, integrating sexuality and spirituality, mentoring the soul's journey
            and creating healing community.  I have worked with gay, lesbian, bisexual
            and transgendered people for most all of my years in practice, as well as
            members of various sexual subcultures.  I am the founder of the Boston Area
            Sexuality and Spirituality Network, a staff writer for Spirituality and
            Sexuality magazine, and author of LIVING WITH VISION: RECLAIMING THE POWER OF
            THE HEART (Knowledge Systems, 1989) and HEALING THE WAR BETWEEN THE GENDERS
            (Forthcoming).  I have led workshops nationally and internationally and
            public speak on a wide variety of subjects including gender and identity,
            gender reconciliation, heart-centered healing and social evolution.





            My Degrees:  I hold a Master's Degree in Organization Development from the
            Sloan School, MIT.  I studied Psychobiology at Yale in the late 70's, prior
            to the availability of body psychotherapy training in any university setting.
             I have been a pioneer in the field of somatic psychology, helping found the
            first state professional association  in Massachusetts in 1989, helping found
            the Somatics Community within the Association for Humanistic Psychology while
            serving on the AHP Board, and through establishing a 3 year apprenticeship
            training program in Emotional-Kinesthetic Psychotherapy (EKP)--the method I
            developed and have practiced since 1985.  My school certified body-centered
            psychotherapists who completed the 1000+ hour program.

Also, disability activist, currently Chair of the City of Cambridge Commission for People with Disabilities.\n\n\n\n \n\nAs a therapist, I provide individual, couple and family psychotherapy to people of all ages, cultures and nationalities; of all gender and sexual expressions; and to people with disabilities of any kind. My current case load includes Asian, African-American, and West Indian\nclients as well as European and Celtic descendants; and includes bi and gay men, lesbians and bi women, poly individuals and couples, cross-dressers and those in the BDSM D/S scene (see below)\nI work in English. I understand West Indian. My secondary office is fully accessible, but I do not have ASL or TTY.   I will work with any level of trouble or \"mental illness,\" including people diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, psychotic illnesses, Aspergers (autism), epilepsy, etc. I also provide consultation of all kinds in psychiatry and therapy issues, second opinions, diagnostic aid, etc.  I work as covering senior clinician for many Cambridge therapists when they are away.\nSome special areas of experience include: ADD & ADHD; Evaluating and supporting people (including children and adolescents) with gender concerns, cross-dressing, and those seeking\ncomplete gender realignment or correction (I  am an approved provider in this speciality).\nI work with artists, actors, performers, writers, poets, and other creatives. I do pre-marital counseling upon request for couples with differences in race, class or  culture; or for couples in which one partner has a significant disability.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a coach, I work with *anyone who has a goal* they are determined\nand committed to achieve. I coach physicians; I coach for ICI, a program for\nwomen with disabilities seeking employment or career development; I coach\nnovelists, screenwriters, contruction workers, nurses, etc.  The Arena\nMethod® is used by coaches in my firm and has proven very dynamic -- it\nteaches clients *how to want something* in the way that ensures getting it.\nFees for coaching are structured differently from most professional\nfees, but are roughly similar to therapy costs overall.  Clients contract\ninitially for 90 days, usually including one 30-minute phone meeting per week\n(clients may be in any part of the world) and weekly structured tasks.\nDifferent service packages provide additional supports according to each\nplan. For the client, coaching requires guts and is a more strenuous course\nthan being in therapy; it also works faster to structure current goals.\n\n\n\n\n\nVitae of publications available upon request."

            I am licensed as a psychotherapist and certified as a sex

            sexually is a part of their core, and that the issues they may have are
            usually a result of life circumstances.  In the process of working
            together, I strive to assist in the natural unfolding of who they are
            sexually. Often, sexual issues are complicated by other general issues,
            such as  relationships, communication, addictions, transitions, and
            professional concerns.




                  Over the years I have worked with many gay and bisexual people. I
            have worked too with people who have concerns about gender identity,
            transvestism,  fetish interests, sexual health and performance, aging,
            and lifestyle issues as they are related to parenting. Often, several of

            I have been in private practice since 1977, and I am a staff member at
            New York Presbyterian Medical Center, a major teaching hospital. In my
            post-graduate training I have focused on family therapy, group therapy and
            psychodrama. Since 1980, after relocating from San Francisco, I have
            been affiliated with a few counseling centers serving the LGBT
            community.  I lead ongoing groups for LGBT clients, and have conducted
            many seminars and workshops in national and international conferences,
            especially on experiential and action methods in psychotherapy. I am
            certified in New York State and by the American Society of Group
            Psychotherapy and Psychodrama. I am currently editing a textbook on
            clinical and educational applications of psychodrama and sociometry.

Also, disability activist, currently Chair of the City of Cambridge Commission for People with Disabilities.\n\n\n\n \n\nAs a therapist, I provide individual, couple and family psychotherapy to people of all ages, cultures and nationalities; of all gender and sexual expressions; and to people with disabilities of any kind. My current case load includes Asian, African-American, and West Indian\nclients as well as European and Celtic descendants; and includes bi and gay men, lesbians and bi women, poly individuals and couples, cross-dressers and those in the BDSM D/S scene (see below)\nI work in English. I understand West Indian. My secondary office is fully accessible, but I do not have ASL or TTY.   I will work with any level of trouble of mental illness, including people diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, psychotic illnesses, Aspergers (autism), epilepsy, etc. I also provide consultation of all kinds in psychiatry and therapy issues, second opinions, diagnostic aid, etc.  I work as covering senior clinician for many Cambridge therapists when they are away.\nSome special areas of experience include: ADD & ADHD; Evaluating and supporting people (including children and adolescents) with gender concerns, cross-dressing, and those seeking\ncomplete gender realignment or correction (I  am an approved provider in this speciality).\nI work with artists, actors, performers, writers, poets, and other creatives. I do pre-marital counseling upon request for couples with differences in race, class or  culture; or for couples in which one partner has a significant disability.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a coach, I work with *anyone who has a goal* they are determined\nand committed to achieve. I coach physicians; I coach for ICI, a program for\nwomen with disabilities seeking employment or career development; I coach\nnovelists, screenwriters, contruction workers, nurses, etc.  The Arena\nMethod® is used by coaches in my firm and has proven very dynamic -- it\nteaches clients *how to want something* in the way that ensures getting it.\nFees for coaching are structured differently from most professional\nfees, but are roughly similar to therapy costs overall.  Clients contract\ninitially for 90 days, usually including one 30-minute phone meeting per week\n(clients may be in any part of the world) and weekly structured tasks.\nDifferent service packages provide additional supports according to each\nplan. For the client, coaching requires guts and is a more strenuous course\nthan being in therapy; it also works faster to structure current goals.\n\n\n\n\n\nVitae of publications available upon request."

        description: "**Workshops and lectures I have given include:**\n\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>**What Therapists Should Know About Working with Bisexual Clients**\n<ul type=\"circle\"><li>How is being bisexual different from being gay or lesbian? What are some specific concerns that bisexuals face? How can a counselor take these issues into account so as to be supportive to their bisexual clients?</li></ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>**When Someone You Know Is Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual**\n<ul type=\"circle\"><li>It is estimated that one out of every ten people is lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Today more and more gay people are finding it possible to come out to their friends, families and co-workers. Come join an open discussion about perceptions of lesbians, gays and bisexuals in society. We will examine stereotypes, explore homophobia, and talk about what it feels like to be different from others. </li></ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>**What Psychology Professionals Should Know About Polyamory: The Lifestyles and Mental Health Concerns of Polyamorous Individuals.** \n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>Polyamory is a lifestyle in which romantic partners agree that they may each have romantic relationships with other people as well. It is distinguished from infidelity by the presence of honest, supportive communication between partners and lovers about the existence of each of these relationships in their lives. This workshop talks about some of the unique concerns that polyamorous people face, and the ways in which a therapist can be supportive of and helpful to their polyamorous clients.</li></ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>**Coming Out Issues Workshop**\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>Lesbians, gays and bisexuals are frequently faced with the decision of whether to come out to their friends, families, and co-workers. Coming out can be associated with both benefits and risks. In this workshop, we will talk about how one might make the decision to come out and about ways of coming out to the people in one's life. We will also talk about community resources that can offer support as these choices are made.</li></ul> \n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>**Bi-Gay Dialogue: Are We Family?** \n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>There have historically been rifts between the bisexual and gay communities. This workshop will examine the sources of those rifts. We will discuss experiences that these two communities have in common, and what each experiences distinctly.

For instance, a two hour lecture in San Francisco would cost $240: 2 hours of lecture at $100 each, plus a half hour each way from my home in San Mateo county (2x20). A two hour lecture in New York would cost $840 plus travel/lodging expenses: 2 hours of lecture at $100 each, 8 hours of travel time each way (16x40 = $640), plus airfare and overnight lodging accomodations.\n</ul>\n\n\n\n**More about me:**\n<ul type=\"disc\">I am an openly bisexual psychologist, practicing in San Francisco (Noe Valley neighborhood). I have experience working within the Bisexual, Lesbian, Gay, Polyamory, Kink/BDSM, HIV+/POZ, and DD communities. My other specialties include relationship work, career counseling, managing depression, anxiety, anger, substance and internet addictions, codependency, and self-acceptance.

            custody of children where alternative lifestyle may be an issue, and
            estate planning - how to deal with lifes downsides outside of the
            traditional "family" structure. Fees vary by service - always offer free
            initial consultation, or within reason will answer e-mailed questions at
            no cost.

            To me, psychotherapy is about supporting people to assume full control of
            their own lives with power, compassion, and joy. The goal of therapy is a
            world full of powerful, loving people at ease with themselves and each
            other.




            I act as a mirror, not a judge, providing you with a reflection of
            yourself, one that you might not have seen before.  With that reflection,
            you can move toward finding solutions or not -- that is up to you.  I
            also help guide you toward developing inner and outer skills to reach
            your goals.




            I have a masters degree in social work (MSW) and have been in this
            helping profession for 17 years. My professional experience includes
            working with people from a variety of age groups and a variety of
            backgrounds.  As a school counselor for many years, I worked with
            children from ages 3 through 14 and with their parents.  As a
            psychotherapist in private practice, I work with all age groups,
            individually and in family groups (twos, threes fours or more).




            I am knowledgeable and experienced both personally and professionally in
            the area of "alternative" lifestyles.  For me, "alternative" means a way
            of life other than what society tells us is the "normal" or "acceptable"
            way.  I have experience working with people who identify as transgender,
            bisexual, lesbian, gay, transsexual, polyamorous, and those involved in
            the bdsm community.




            I can be reached at 732.729.9768 or email: sept255@aol.com.  Please feel
            free to contact me if you have any questions or would like more
            information about me.

        description: "I am a bisexual psychologist and energy/journeywork practitioner.  I have 26 years of experience doing psychotherapy with English-speaking clients of all sexual and gender orientations in the Boston Area. I work with individuals, families and both monogamous and polyamorous relationships. In terms of age, I see folks in their teens all the way through some courageous women and men in their elder years.\n\n\n\n \nMy training includes expressive and creative versions of psychotherapy as well as traditional \"talk therapy\" and I enjoy doing both. In fact, I just enjoy and am grateful each client I see. After 26 years, I am still awed by my clients' wisdom, courage, and resiliency and honored to help with healing or personal growth. I have particular interest in LGBT issues, recovery from addictions, including co-dependency and eating disorders, and trauma. I also assist clients with depression, anxiety, grieving, life transitions, and career issues. I also work with those who want to include their religious or spiritual perspective in their psychotherapy.\n\n\n\n \nI did the first research on bisexual women's and men's experiences of mental health services and do presentations on this and other topics having to do with \"bi\" issues in the Boston Area and at National and International Conferences on Bisexuality.  An article presenting my research will be in the upcoming Journal of Bisexuality to be published early in 2004. I am Co-Chair of the Committee on Bisexual Issues in Psychology of the American Psychological Association's Division 44 (Society for the Psychological Study of LGB Issues).\n\n\n\n\nMy fee: $100. I can slide lower in some cases of need. I am not currently on insurance panels, but that should change during 2004. Some insurance plans will partially reimburse members for sessions with non-network providers and I am happy to work with clients to facilitate insurer co-payments when that is the case."

            I assist those entering a transition in their lives struggling with
            Relationship Issues, Additions, Value changes, Exploration of Gender and
            Sexual Orientation and its influence upon ones choices, and the pain,
            confusion and excitement of personal growth. I use a Task Centered
            Approach to treatment and begin by listening carefully and setting goals
            for each client and our work together.




            In my view, the concerns people bring to therapy are often not a matter
            of illness, but part of a clients quest for greater wholeness and
            gratification in life. I believe that the human psyche has the ability to
            heal itself and that I can help individuals facilitate the healing
            process. I further believe that therapy needs to be a good fit between
            therapist and client. I offer a comfortable, safe and confidential
            environment where clients can better cope with their personal issues,
            become more self aware and gain a better understanding of their
            interactions with the people in their past, present and future. For those
            unable to travel to my office I have a fully functional online therapy

            Jennifer Isham, MA, NCC, LCPC, CS is a certified sexologist and licensed
            therapist who uses a psycho-spiritual approach to therapy. Sheldon Lewin
            LCSW, MBA a licensed clinical social worker specializing in bisexuality.
            Together they have combined there knowledge, skills, and expertise to
            provide a model of therapy for working with bisexual clients, their spouses
            and partners which effectively acknowledges multiple points of input. Using
            collaborative therapy they combine the logic of masculine energy with the
            intuitive wisdom of female energy to help individuals and couples discover,
            explore and learn to accept themselves and their relationships.





            Typically this type of therapy will benefit individuals and couples seeking
            to understand and accept the larger purpose for their relationships, sexual
            curiosities, desires, needs, and wants. Jennifer and Sheldon use a
            psycho-spiritual and clinical approach to working with people that is
            empathic and supportive yet provocatively challenging. They are known for
            helping move people beyond their comfort zones, look at their lives in
            different contexts, and transition through challenges into awareness,
            change, and growth. They are passionate advocates of helping people discover
            and give life to their unique and personal voices. Through collaborative
            therapy they help people in the following areas:





            Sexuality


            .       Explore the masculine and female energy within themselves


            *       Develop comfort with their sexuality and increase sexual pleasure


            *       Develop communication skills to express authenticity and foster healthy sexuality


            *       Understand the challenges and strengths of sexual awareness


            *       Learn to embrace and celebrate sex and sexuality


            *       Sexual addiction (compulsivity)





            Relationships


            *       Work through life transitions (marriage, midlife, divorce, custody, remarriage, lifestyle changes)


            *       Deception, betrayal and issues around infidelity


            *       Managing feelings of anger, fear, shock, despair, and devastation


            *       Damaged self esteem and sexual rejection


            *       Coping with shame and secrecy


            *       Difficulty accepting your spouse or partners sexuality


            *       Fears of having been exposed to sexually transmitted diseases or AIDS





            Bisexuality


            *       Discover bisexuality as a powerful metaphor for the spiritual self and can bring awareness to other areas of duality in your life


            *       Explore bisexuality or being bi-curious. Am I on a journey from bi-curious to bisexual? Am I on a journey of exploring bisexuality and then accepting or rejecting it?


            *       Explore the differences of being ashamed of being bisexual versus the shame our present society places on those   living a bisexual lifestyle

            training at Massachusetts General Hospital and Fenway Community Health, a
            health center that serves primarily the BGLT community, and I remain
            affiliated with both.  I offer individual psychotherapy to adults of all
            ages, and my specialty area is with Bisexual individuals, Transgender and
            Gender Variant individuals, and Gay and Lesbian individuals.  Other
            specialties include anxiety, depression, relationship difficulties,
            mindfulness-based therapies, and trauma.  My past research has addressed
            anti-BGL hate-crime victimization, and I have taught and made
            professional presentations concerning that topic, as well as the
            commonalities between the Bisexual and Transgender movements.  My
            standard fee is $125 per session.  I am a pending provider for BC/BS and

            I offer counselling and psychotherapy services to individuals, couples and
            families, including children of all ages. My background is in teaching,
            research and education and I am particularly interested in issues of gender,
            sexuality and diversity. I am a native speaker of Italian and am also fluent
            in British Sign Language (CACDP Stage 3), as well as English. I have
            worked in CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) clinics for
            two years, whilst a trainee, and I am currently working as a volunteer
            family therapist with PACE, London, where I work with LGBT couples and
            families. I am also an active researcher and writer:

            My service is for anyone who wishes to seek counselling or psychotherapy.
            You may be facing particular issues, such as depression, relationship
            breakdown, retirement, parenthood, homophobia or you may like to just have
            some time to think about your life with someone outside of your everyday
            circle of support. If you are uncertain about whether this service is for
            you, feel free to contact me for an initial discussion.The service can be

            A one-hour session costs 45 pounds. Please note that the first session is offered
            for 30 pounds and will last 45 minutes. (If you are unsure on whether
            therapy is for you or would like to ask some questions/meet me prior to the
            first session, a shorter, initial consultation of 20 minutes is offered for
            free, usually on the telephone or online, but face-to-face is also available
            if preferred). Discounts are available when paying for a block of sessions
            in advance. Please enquire during the first meeting. If the session is to
            take place at your home and you live more than 5 miles from Hemel Hempstead,
            there will be an additional charge for travelling time and petrol. A written
            agreement can be negotiated during the first session.

            I work with individuals, partners, couples, families and groups. We explore the spoken and unspoken dynamics of intimacy and boundaries with self and others, of parent-child bonding, and of navigating conflicts, wounding, and trauma past or present. I also work with addictions. My approach is holistic, body-oriented, offers use of expressive arts, and celebrates diversity, particularly of sexual orientation and partnering styles, gender, and spirituality.





            I consider therapy a collaborative process, so I work best with clients who have a sense of what troubles them and at least a vague vision for the differences they want. That is where I come in.





            I will use my skills to help you identify what specifically is not working for you in your life, develop a vision for the way you wish things were instead, and then narrow that gap. I will follow your lead in setting goals together for the therapy while also utilizing my professional perspectives and experience. My intention is to support an integrated dynamic within your body, mind, emotions, spirit, relationships with others, and with your unique conception of the world in which you live.





            While we will probably explore your past experiences, our focus will be on your present experiences and your hopes and desires for your future.





            I have offered professional trainings on Poly Parenting Issues, Self-Care, and Expressive Arts Therapy Techniques, and am in progress on a Poly-Aware Professionals Clinical Handboook.

            Reed Lindberg, M.A., L.P.C., is the Managing Director of the Boulder
            Psychotherapy Institute. He is a therapist with 20 years experience.
            He refers to his work as Relationship, Sex and Romance Counseling.





            Reed works with people of all sexual orientations, and feels
            privileged to share in the inner and interpersonal worlds of his
            clients and to work with them on their personal and relationship
            issues. He works to restore playfulness and trust to a relationship
            that may have grown mired in everyday life. His therapy is a mutual
            exploration of a couples issues and strengths. He does work with both
            individuals and couples.





            Reed uses an existential perspective supplemented by Gestalt therapy
            and other approaches. Existential therapy starts from the assumption
            that we do not have a static self and are free to make significant
            changes in our lives and in the ways that we relate to each other. It
            encourages each persons freedom while building relationship. It works
            with authenticity. Neither freedom nor connectedness are ignored.





            A therapist must be willing to go there with clients if he is to
            help them extricate themselves from the impact of the past. But he
            believes that it is the release of creativity and authentic
            relatedness in the present that is the aim of psychotherapy. Reed
            offers a free initial meeting to help see if we will work well together.





            Reed also works with language and communication to help change the
            style of a couples dynamics. Resentments and even anger may tinge a
            couples interactions - a trusted third party, through observation and
            coaching, can help modify the words and attitudes that bring
            frustration to a relationship.





            To understand, respect, and be present to the lived reality of others
            is one of the great privileges of living in relationship and of being
            a psychotherapist.

            I provide compassionate and affirming psychotherapy for individuals,
            couples, families and adolescents.  I have special expertise working with
            folk who are bisexual, lesbian, gay, transgender, and queer.  I identify as
            a gay man myself, am sex-positive, and non-judgemental about the diverse
            ways we express our love and desires.  I have been working and volunteering
            in the DC community since 1996.





            I strive to create a space where you can feel safe speaking of any concern
            or thought.  I won't judge you, think that you're crazy nor immoral.
            Together we find ways to enhance your creative thinking, express authentic
            emotions, and make effective actions.  We explore your life and the ways you
            feel you can change.





            While I am not with any insurance companies, my services may be reimbursable
            through your plans out-of-network benefits.  I have limited availability
            for negotiated fees.  Feel free to call for a phone consultation at no
            charge.

            Often times, how we feel about ourselves, others, and situations has a lot to do with the stories of our lives and problems that are manufactured in social, cultural and political contexts. I collaborate with clients to create alternate stories that creatively solve their problems and increase their fulfillment in life. As a result, I am very committed to understanding and incorporating cultural aspects of the clients life into treatment. I view therapy as a collaborative experience where we select goals/objectives that will help you become the person you want or experience the relief you seek.






            One important mission for me is to provide lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer communities an affirming therapeutic environment where ones sexual orientation and gender identity are understood and supported, free from the judgment that homosexual, bisexual or transgender experiences are pathological. I honor the range of diversity within all of us.






            I provide psychological assessment and psychotherapy for individuals experiencing anxiety and mood disorders, persons grappling with gender and/or sexual identity issues, or those adjusting to the many ways of being masculine. I also provide therapy for persons seeking help related to the lived-experience of AIDS/HIV, sexual abuse and PTSD.

            I work with compassion, respect and acceptance. I don't judge. Therapy is a collaborative process where I am your expert guide. It's important to me that you maintain control at all times and feel safe. I do my best to hear you. There is nothing we can't talk about. That includes how we -- therapist and client -- relate to each other. We can discuss anything while ensuring that clear boundaries and mutual consent are respected.

            My approach to treatment is informed by multicultural counseling principles and by existential/humanistic philosophy, which suggests that all people are searching for meaning in their lives and aspire to feel connected to others, while struggling with feeling alone in the world. Feeling isolated can be particularly poignant for bisexual people. I have worked with clients from diverse racial and ethnic groups, from various socioeconomic circumstances, of different ages and sexual and gender identities. I provide affirming support while challenging clients to identify obstacles to the realization of their potential. My office is conveniently located in Union Square; I offer affordable fees and a sliding scale application for clients in need.





            I specialize in working with clients who identify as transgender, HIV+ or bisexual, those involved in BDSM, kinky, or polyamorous relationships, and any clients struggling with depression, anxiety, or life adjustments (aging, career change, bereavement). I have experience working with same sex and serodiscordant couples. I appreciate working with clients who have a desire to achieve or maintain recovery from addiction to substances, sex, pornography, or codependent relationships, as I have personal experience with recovery. I believe that each of us has the capacity to change and that altering patterns of self-destructive behavior enables us to create lives that are more free and fulfilling.





            As a researcher, I have given presentations and workshops at the New York Mental Health Counselors Association, American Psychological Association, Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality, Philadelphia Trans Health Conference, Southeastern Regional Counseling Psychology conference, the Institute for Human Identity, and the State Society on Aging of New York. I am a hotline volunteer for the New York Anti-Violence Project, a former peer counselor for Identity House, and a former counseling intern at Iris House, a community center seving people living with HIV/AIDS.

            Folks who identify as bisexual or bi-curious have distinctive concerns.  While not every client will have a need to discuss their orientation, every client deserves a therapist who is completely accepting and affirmative of their orientation and gender expresssion.





            I have facilitated adult bisexual and bi-curious mens groups at Fenway Community Health in Boston for the last 7 years.  Groups have included college students to older folks and have addressed a broad range of subjects, including <u>Getting Past Stereotypes</u>, <u>Monogamy and Polyamory</u>, <u>Bisexuality and Desire</u> <u>Coming Out</u>, <u>Safer Sex</u>, <u>Queer Sexuality</u>, and <u>Bisexuality in the Workplace</u>.  Check out the groups website at the <a href="http://www.fenwayhealth.org/site/PageServer?pagename=FCHC_srv_services_bi"><u>Fenway Community Health - Bisexual Health page</u></a>





            I have presented educational workshops on bisexuality for therapists through the National Association of Social Workers.  As a previous member of the Massachusetts statewide LGBT Liaison Committee to the Department of Children and Families, I continually advocated for the inclusion of bisexual families' concerns.  Through my initiative, the agency began marching in the Boston Youth Pride parade each May, visibly demonstrating support for the spectrum of LGBT youth.

            In addition to my work with adults, I work with kids, teens, and young adults, including gender-variant and trans youth.  I have worked with youth with mental health concerns for over ten years, both 1-on-1 and with family members in the room.  Areas of experience include a broad range of mental health, social, educational, and familial stresses, as well as parent consultation.  I have supported numerous families seeking special education supports both within and beyond their public school district.

            I am a queer therapist whose clients include individuals and couples from the GLBTQ, kink, and BDSM communities.





            Although often difficult periods of change can give us opportunities to bring our lives more in alignment with what has true value and meaning for ourselves. I work with people during important transitions in their lives, for instance either starting or leaving a significant job or relationship.





            Communication, trust, intimacy and/ or sexual issues with your partner? I am very comfortable working with traditional, alternative and queer couples. I assist you and your partner to develop better communication and understanding around sensitive topics such as betrayal, intimacy and trust.





            As former Director of the Eating Disorders program at Community Institute of San Rafael, Marin, I work with people who obsess that if they only had the perfect weight their lives would work out. So many of us through overdieting and body hatred have lost our connection to ourselves. The body instead of being home for our psyche/ spirit becomes the battleground. I work with clients to get off the fasting/ feasting cycle and reclaim their appetite for life. I also lead support/ psycho-educational groups for women with food/ weight and body image struggles.





            Do you feel emotionally stuck in the past? You might be suffering from trauma. I help my clients move through past traumatic experiences using EMDR (eye movement desensitization reprocessing) This well researched method has fast and effective results in working with people suffering from trauma. I also help my clients release the cellular and muscular memory of the trauma (which is where trauma is often stored) using somatic psychotherapy. This is an approach that taps into body awareness and mindfulness, which does not involve touch.





            Please check my website (above) for more information and articles written.

I assist clients with bisexual related issues ranging from questioning ones sexual identity and coming out to ones self, to coping with biphobia from the gay community and reconciling a bisexual identity within a monogamous relationship. I help bisexuals go through the process of deciding if, when and how to come out to others including their parents, spouses, children and religious community. I help those who have had someone close to them come out as bisexual cope with this revelation and learn how best to respond. I work with bisexuals dealing with polyamorous issues as well.                  \n\n\n\n\nI help clients process and understand what is happening in their life. Information, guidance, and support are geared towards helping the client find a way to move towards a more workable, satisfying, and happy future. Through a process of questions, conversations, and education, I help clients discover within themselves an understanding of what they ultimately, realistically, want the outcome of their situation to be. Together we explore the clients options so they can come up with the best choices for achieving their vision for their future. Arming the client with coping and conversational skills, I will see them through the process. I also offer consulting services to other professionals and businesses who work with or do business with bisexuals.\n\n\n\n                                                               50-minute Skype sessions are $45, and also include: An initial free consultation to determine if we are a right fit for each other, an assessment questionnaire, personalized action plans, personalized activities and/or reading assignments geared toward helping the client further their goals, and materials and resources customized towards the clients particular issues/goals."

        description: I specialize in treating sexually diverse populations, especially under-served populations such as bisexual and other non-monosexual clients, transgender and other gender variant clients, and those in the kink and poly communities. I also treat sexual problems and concerns and have training in sex therapy. I work with clients ages 12 and up, and treat couples and families as well as individuals. I offer therapy groups for adolescents and young adults including LGBTQ-spectrum groups. I am sex-positive and queer-affirmative. I understand that while identity issues may be a focus of therapy, in other cases, a client may simply seek a therapist who understands their identity so that they can safety and comfortably talk about whatever else may be of concern.

            I am a queer-identified licensed clinical psychologist with a private practice. I also supervise trainees at Queer LifeSpace, a nonprofit providing low-fee mental health and substance abuse services to the LGBTQQI communities. My office is centrally located in the Mission District of San Francisco, where I offer individual psychotherapy for adults.





            My specific areas of interest and expertise are:





            Alcohol and Substance Use Concerns


            Harm Reduction and Motivational Interviewing Techniques


            Depression, Anxiety, and Mood Disorders


            Recovery from Trauma and Loss


            Social Justice Conversations


            Habit Change and Goal-Setting


            Employment and Career Consultation


            Exploring Identity


            Anger Management and Conflict Resolution





            I welcome all to my practice, and am particularly interested in inviting those who may not feel as comfortable in all treatment spaces: members of the LGBTQQIAAP communities, gender-creative folks, people wanting to talk about size acceptance, people of color and members of marginalized groups, those in non-traditional relationships (polyamory, kink/BDSM), iconoclastic artists and activists, Burners and nerds, and everyone else who struggles with how to succeed on this planet without forcing themselves to fit in.





            My rate is $150. I am currently an in-network provider for Cigna Behavioral Health, and am in process with other insurance plans. If I am not on your plan, I can provide invoices you may submit for reimbursement. Free initial telephone consultation.

I approach this work with a collaborative style, supporting people as they engage in their therapy experience. I provide non-judgmental supportive therapy for people with a range of sexual, relationship, and gender identities and experiences, including LGBTQIQA2S, BDSM, sexual variations, furries, non-monogamy, non binary gender and gender fluidity, and sex workers. I specialize in working through sexuality/gender/relationship related concerns, and supporting these folks with the other aspects of their inner and outer worlds. In my practice and in my world, I acknowledge and work to address systematic and environmental barriers and oppression, and I strive to build a practice and a therapeutic space that includes all aspects of your world. I focus on trauma recovery, body image, disability, impulse control, depression, anxiety, creating boundaries, self esteem, empowerment, substance abuse, adaptive coping skills, and relationships.  I believe that therapy should be accessible for everybody who wants it. As part of my efforts to increase access to supportive services, I use a sliding scale and accept Medi-Cal. Please feel free to contact me for more information or to schedule an appointment.

            Welcoming clients to my busy UK Midlands-based private practice for weekly or fortnightly appointments, in person locally or nationally/internationally via Skype.





            Personal therapy provided focuses on exploring and effecting change on past patterns, facilitating personal growth, self-development and self-actualisation. Specialisations; sexuality, gender, abuse, trauma, depression, anxiety and relationship issues. Taking you from who and where you are now to who and where you want to be, using your own mind, body and spirit.





            Familiar and experienced with alternative lifestyle choices and identities, therefore particularly but not exclusively working with adult and young adult clients from within LGBTQ, polyamory, tantra, spirituality and kink communities. Knowing that this is an aspect of your life that I will not automatically pathologise often provides a strong and creative start to working together.





            Additional experience that informs my practice includes life coaching, mentoring, cognitive behavioural hypnotherapy and N.L.P. Rich background of Consulting, Presenting and Facilitating extensive classes, workshops, groups and talks e.g. at five UK Universities and for national events/organisations such as (keynote speaker at) the Pink Therapy Conference, SMPride, Kinkfest 2004 (Organising Director), Polyday, Tantra4GayMen, Unitarian Youth Workers Training Conference. KAP listed (NCSF Kink Aware Professionals).





            I have a reputation for healing the healers and holding those who hold. Is it time you put on your own oxygen mask first?

As the voted San Francisco Bay Area American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors & Therapists (AASECT) leader, I am extremely active in promoting positive sexual health in various Bay Area communities. Within these communities there are members that identify as bisexual, gay, lesbian, transgendered, kink & BDSM friendly, swingers, cisgendered and polyamorous.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my work, I constantly strive to grow and learn as a therapist in order to provide the best opportunities to my clients and the communities in which I serve. These include reading various articles in the field of sexual health and bisexuality, attending on-going trainings and workshops held by SSTAR, AASECT, Good Vibrations and other well-known sexual health organizations, and working with clients that identify as bisexual. Some of my areas of focus include kink, BDSM, polyamory, high-low desire, pornography, grief & loss, infidelity, self-esteem, career counseling, and overall relationship counseling. \nAdditionally, I have a podcast called Lets Do It With Melissa Risso which focuses on promoting healthy conversations around both mental and sexual health.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith patience and persistence, my clients cultivate greater confidence and self-esteem, richer relationships, and more emotional balance and health. I believe that we all need someone to talk with who will listen and accept us as we are, without judgment. Because of this, I provide my clients with a warm, nonjudgmental environment- a safe place to explore the issues that may be preventing people from living the life they want."

            I have been working in behavioral health field since 1994, been in private practice since 2004 and a sex positive sex therapist since 2008.





            Although I have experience in working with a wide range of sexual dysfunctions, I have an expert focus is in atypical sexual expressions and emerging definitions of healthy sexuality.  My professional and personal coaching services are unique and different than most practicing professionals in that it incorporates various mainstream clinical best practices like Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, with depth psychological approaches to understanding conscious and unconscious forces contributing to long held and frustrating patterns.  At its detriment, modern training and practice of counseling and therapy primarily focus on behavioral changes, which are minimally impactful and do not address long term, unresolved core psychological issues.  These unresolved issues present themselves as sexual dysfunctions, psychiatric illness, maladaptive behaviors or substance abuse/dependence which impede or block healthy professional and personal growth and development.  Core psychological issues involve, in part, male and feminine energy; sexual and non-sexual power dynamics; as well as the "shadow" aspect of the unconscious self, which drives uncontrollable (conscious & unconscious) desires and ineffective redundant behaviors.  It is because of this and other limitations; traditional counseling and therapy results in short lived success, increased frustration and the eroding of hope each time the individual or couple returns for additional treatment.  Like professional consultations, educational seminars and trainings, psychotherapy and sex therapy sessions are dynamic and tailored to the clients specific needs and goals.





            Personally, I identify, in part, as bisexual/Queer man.

        description: "Workshops and lectures I have given include:\n\n\n\n\n\n**What Therapists Should Know About Working with Bisexual Clients**\n\n\n\n\nHow is being bisexual different from being gay or lesbian? What are some specific concerns that bisexuals face? How can a counselor take these issues into account so as to be supportive to their bisexual clients?\n\n\n\n\n\n**What Psychology Professionals Should Know About Polyamory: The Lifestyles and Mental Health Concerns of Polyamorous Individuals.**\n\n\n\n\nPolyamory is a lifestyle in which romantic partners agree that they may each have romantic relationships with other people as well. It is distinguished from infidelity by the presence of honest, supportive communication between partners and lovers about the existence of each of these relationships in their lives. This workshop talks about some of the unique concerns that polyamorous people face, and the ways in which a therapist can be supportive of and helpful to their polyamorous clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n**What Therapists Should Know About Working with Clients Who Are Members of the BDSM Community**\n\n\n\n\nAbout 5-10 percent of the US population practices some variety of bdsm play, but most therapists do not have an understanding of what this means in their clients lives, nor how to distinguish between BDSM and abuse. This lecture aims to address some of the common misperceptions about BDSM, and suggest ways in which a therapist can be supportive of and helpful to their BDSM community clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Workshop/Lecture Fees:**\n\n\n\n\n\nI charge $200 per hour of presentation time, plus travel and lodging expenses if the lecture is outside of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n\n\n \n\n**More about me:**\n\n\n\n\nI am an openly bisexual psychologist, practicing in Los Altos, CA. I have experience working within the Bisexual, Lesbian, Gay, Polyamory, Kink/BDSM, HIV+/POZ, and DD communities. My other specialties include relationship work, career counseling, managing depression, anxiety, anger, substance and internet addictions, codependency, and self-acceptance.

        description: 'I am an active therapist in that I ask questions and offer consistent feedback to guide the session''s focus. I utilize an integrative style - applying a variety of approaches to best meet the needs of each client/couple and their concerns. It is my belief that the counseling process is one in which all parties are actively involved. I recognize the need for flexibility and creativity to address the mind and body. My approach focuses identifying physical cues, recognizing thoughts, considering consequences, implementing solutions, choosing behaviors, and promoting expression.  I am a certified clinical hypnotherapist, who holds an advanced certification in stress management and author of "The Anger Management Workbook for Men". I believe that therapy is a proven, effective way to help people overcome emotional problems. I find satisfaction in being able to guide clients on their journey as they navigate obstacles and endure struggle, only to come out healthier and more confident. All humans struggle with their feelings and its a sign of strength and intelligence to know when to seek support. Any professional who has useful skills and the right tools, is an asset, not a liability. I am an in-network provider with BCBS and provide individual/relationship counseling that specializes in: Intimacy (Physical & Emotional), Identity & Sexuality (Bi, Poly, Trans, Kink), Anger Management, Depression and Anxiety, Relationship Problems, Life Transitions, Grief and Loss, Work and Career Issues, Stress Management.'

            Philosophy and Approach: I believe that each person deserves to thrive and create the best life possible for them. I utilize a multifaceted approach that is tailored to the client depending on their presenting concerns, goals, needs, and strengths. Sessions are person centered and address treatment goals by applying Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Positive Psychology, Motivational Interviewing, and Mindfulness techniques.





            I specialize in gender and sexual minority support. I have experience with youth and adults in the LGBTQIAQ and Poly-Alt-Kink communities. I believe that individuals have the right to get support from someone that is familiar with the unique considerations of these communities. I also understand how membership in these communities is not one's entire identity. As individuals all people face a complex range of ups and downs in life which may or may not be impacted by intersectional identities.





            Fees: Group facilitation, individual counseling and partners counseling services are all offered at a standard rate of $40 per 50 minute session after an initial $75 fee for a 90 min intake session. I offer a sliding scale in situations of significant financial hardship so that finances are not a barrier to receiving support. I provide a quarterly support group for current clients at no fee.

            I believe that therapy is a space where you can share your experience while being heard and appreciated as you are; together we will reflect on your unique strengths, identities, and obstacles to create steps towards change or growth that feel not only tolerable, but also possible.

            Embracing Pleasure is heart-centered, trauma-informed coaching, bodywork, and education for adults of all genders, sizes, relationship statuses, and sexualities who are struggling with identity, sexuality, intimacy, or trauma and who long to be seen. I find my clients come to me because something has changed in the way they are relating to themselves, their lover(s), and/or the world. Something feels off, and my clients are looking for support and guidance to a greater depth of experience and a more whole version of themselves and their sex/life!





            My approach is based on my Master's degree in Sacred Erotic Psychology, certifications in Sexological Bodywork, Clinical Trauma Professional, and Transpersonal Hypnotherapy, as well as numerous hours of work with clients and with myself. I have extensive knowledge of and personal experience with truma, kink/bdsm, polyamory/non-monogamy, queer/lgbp+ and trans/non-binary experiences, and more.





            Sessions are a blend of therapeutic talking/mind-based interaction, body-based/embodiment exercises, and/or educational-therapeutic touch. The session experience is completely dependent upon your goals, and focused on increasing your experience of embodiment and intimacy with yourself, others, and the world.

I am sensitive to the politics of gender identity and sexual orientation, including those that people who identify as bisexual might experience, and the ways in which these politics may inform our experience of self and of our relationships. I work from a perspective of honouring and connecting to our values, strengths and preferences as a way of moving through times of personal and relationship struggle.

            As a therapist, I am passionate about supporting people on their journeys to discovering their true selves, and helping them to build greater resources for meeting all of lifes challenges.





            Identifying as bisexual, queer, or in other non-normative ways that seem to defy labeling, have their unique challenges. You may feel rejected or misunderstood by many different groups, or you may have been the subject of stereotypes and judgments about your sexuality. Like any other form of discrimination, these experiences can lead to feelings of alienation, invisibility, and lowered self-worth, which have a particularly negative impact on mental health.





            My approach is to hold a safe space for you to be seen and heard. Together, our work may include increasing self-esteem and self-empowerment, dialoguing with the inner critic, who may be holding negative self-beliefs, and coping with the outer critics - the people around you who do not seem to understand.





            I specialize in somatic psychotherapy, which is an effective approach to working with depression, anxiety, trauma and PTSD. I also have experience working with intimate relationships, communication problems, life transitions, adjusting to change, and finding life meaning and purpose.

            Hello there! I am a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Associate working with individuals, relationships/couples, and families. As a systemically trained therapist, I take a holistic approach when working with my clients. I work with adolescents and adults, and I specifically focus on addressing concerns of individuals in the LGBTQIA+ community, as well as those in the kink/BDSM community and consensual non-monogamy.





            I am trained in addressing individual and relational concerns including (but not limited to) areas of substance abuse, body image and eating disorders, technology use/concerns, trauma, sexual and/or gender identity, diversity/minority issues, acculturation/assimilation concerns, depression/anxiety, stress, relationship concerns and pre-marital counseling, infidelity, grief & loss, and family communication/conflict.





            I am currently finishing my doctorate degree in Couples, Marriage, and Family Therapy at Texas Tech University, and I have published several articles and presented workshops around issues of disordered eating, substance abuse, technology use, and bisexuality/sexual identity.





            I am fluent in English and Russian.






            I also provide online/teletherapy to clients residing anywhere in Texas.

I have experience working with gender, sexual, and relational diversity and am open-minded and non-judgmental.  As your therapist, I will strive to create a warm, collaborative relationship with you. My goal is to create a meaningful therapeutic context in which each client feels safe, seen, and heard. Whether your concerns relate to life transitions, depression, anxiety, relationships, external stressors, or personal growth, our work will be in a caring environment. My therapeutic approach is grounded in the most current, culturally-aware, trauma-informed, and evidence-based practices, including Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT), Mindfulness, Narrative Therapy, and Motivational Interviewing. \n\n\n\n\n\nMy own experiences of personal transition have shown me that life affords us many opportunities for growth and change - as individuals, and in our relationships with family members, partners, and friends. In my practice I focus on thinking and attachment patterns, and on the many personal, social, and cultural factors that contribute to resilience. Whatever your goals for therapy, I'm here to help. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note: Since I'm active in the local community and attend local events, it's possible that we may know some of the same people, and this is something we should discuss at the outset. If it's a concern, I'll provide you with appropriate referrals."

            The unique thing I offer is a deep understanding of what it's like to live "in between". To live in the middle space of the sexuality spectrum. Whether you identify as bisexual, pansexual, queer, or fluid; I'm here for you. Living in that middle place is something I have specialized training and experience working with. I am passionate about supporting the bi+ community and helping the invisible become visible. One of my favorite things I have done in my career is run bi+ support groups.





            We will work together to help you feel more at ease, empowered, and maybe even allow yourself to be imperfect once in a while. When you begin to accept all the parts of yourself with compassion, things begin to change. You find your voice. I look forward to discovering your voice together.

            I am an openly bi/queer-identified psychotherapist with a private practice in downtown Seattle. I work with people who experience themselves as outsiders to the dominant culture: creative artists, performers, activists, LGBTQ, and gender-nonconforming folks, and anyone else who feels "other" due to cultural or family bias. My approach is trauma-informed, anti-oppression-focused, social-justice oriented and politicized. I have provided trainings on affirmative care for LGBTQ children and youth for Cascadia Training, The Saying it Out Loud Conference and Gender Odyssey, and I served on the Advisory Board on the Children's Hospital Gender Clinic from 2016 -2018. Most recently I have decided to devote more time to supporting fellow bisexuals with their mental health and have started training other clinicians on best practices for working with bisexual clients (for more information on my trainings, go to: http://www.christinamalecka.com/workshops/2019/1/27/so-youre-straight-now-clinical-considerations-for-working-with-bipansexual-clients).





            I am trained extensively in LGBTQ health issues, intimate partner violence, adoption and trauma, and practice EMDR and Attachment-Focused EMDR.  I work with individual clients age 13 and up and I am available for consultation with other therapists. For more about my work, go to my website at christina@christinamalecka.com.

        description: "I am a bisexual-, pansexual-, poly- and open relationship-affirming therapist. I provide therapy to teens, adults, and couples who want to connect with their personal values, live more authentically, and find deeper connection in relationships. I understand the unique cultural challenges of being bisexual, without making assumptions about your personal experience. My style of therapy is genuine, energetic, down-to-earth, skill-based, and filled with humor. Therapy is a transformational experience that can help move you from feeling stuck and hopeless to realizing (or remembering!) what your strengths are and using them to create meaningful change to live the life you prefer. \n\n\n\n\n\nI have experience working with people who struggle with substance abuse and other addictions, suicidal thoughts, and mental illness, although I do not believe that you have to have a diagnosis in order to benefit from therapy. I also enjoy being an expert ear for someone who has a family member or loved one dealing with mental illness or addiction. If you are dealing with any of these issues, or simply want an affirming and non- judgemental therapist, give me a call!"

        description: Elizabeth Galen, Ph.D., is a unique intuitive healer who combines her metaphysical skills with rigorous intellectual training and a life of challenging experiences to provide help for others facing difficult challenges in their own lives. As an intuitive healing coach, Elizabeth's work encompasses many different avenues and takes the form that each client needs whether it is talking, researching, connecting with higher powers, utilizing energy healing methods, or referring to practitioners with different solutions. Unifying her work is a belief that the mind, body and spirit are all one unit, and that in order to heal one, people have to heal them all. Clients come to Elizabeth for a variety of reasons. The common theme with these clients is that they are seeking to heal. The struggles they face may be physical, mental, emotional, relational, sexual or spiritual in origin. Elizabeth has particular experience working with those who endure stubborn health challenges such as Lyme disease, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple chemical sensitivities, and many other chronic illnesses and conditions. Elizabeth has firsthand experience in healing from PTSD and C-PTSD in ways that are far gentler and more compassionate than those advocated by mainstream treatment. She also helps many who are looking to live "greener" lives without synthetic chemicals, who have suffered the death of a baby, or who simply want to approach their problems in different ways. In combining her wide range of skills, Elizabeth Galen helps clients discover new ways to heal when especially in cases when there seems to be little hope.

            I am an openly queer therapist working with individuals, couples, and consenting non-monogamy-poly relationships.  My affirming therapy approach supports individuals of diverse sexualities communities, including LGBTQ+ individuals, kink, BDSM, consensual non-monogamy, swingers, polyamory, and sex workers.   I work with those who experience anxiety, depression, intimacy, and sexual health-related challenges, or trauma.





            As an affirming therapist in San Diego, I wish to help you through the fear of being misunderstood, so we can get to the issues that are most pressing to you. My approach to therapy is through relational models such as Emotionally Focused Therapy and Gottman as well as cognitive-behavioral therapy.  Knowing yourself is the key to knowing why you behave and feel the way you do. Through self-exploration, you will develop better self-awareness. You will understand what elicits anxiety and what makes you feel happy and satisfied--where you identify your emotions and reactions to outside stressors.  Do not waste another minute being paralyzed by fear of not being heard or supported for the life you live.

I have experience working with bisexual, pansexual, and other nonmonosexual clients as individuals and in various relationship configurations. As a marriage and family therapist, I have been trained to do therapy with a person's "system," even when they are coming in for individual therapy services. I use a variety of different techniques, including mindfulness, narrative therapy, sandtray, and play therapy. At this time, I am in the process of being paneled with various insurance companies; I also accept cash clients. Please call to see if I am in network for you!

            GG Wilbur provides a variety of services within the field of sexology.  I provide sexual education starting with the basics through advanced techniques and practices.  As a sex coach, I am trained in working with clients to identify and reach their goals in healthy forms of sexual expression.  I utilize the MEBES model that was developed by Dr. Patti Britton.





            The MEBES model is a holistic approach that employs the mind, emotions, body, energy, and spirit.  As a sexologist, I can provide sex coaching to resolve sexual issues and concerns.  Even if you have no sexual issues or concerns, my services can take you to higher levels of spiritual sexual enlightenment.





            Specialties





            My specialty areas are sacred sexuality and spiritual sexual enlightenment.  I utilize techniques based in Tantra, and Taoist teachings in working within spiritual sexuality.  I serve people in the Bi+, Pagan, BDSM, and Burning Man communities.





            The following are services that I provide:





            Spiritual Sexuality





            Sacred Sexuality and Sexual Enlightenment





            Body Image Healing





            Expanding sexual expression





            Living a sex positive lifestyle free of guilt and shame
