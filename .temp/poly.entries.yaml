        description: Ultra-traditional marriage arrangements may be stale and unsatisfying, but at least everybody knows what is expected of them.  The male brings home the bacon, the female fries it up in a pan and nobody as a boyfriend or girlfriend.  Polyamory may seem to be freespirit, but I believe couples have to make sure they\'re extra clear about rules and expectations,  Each couple (or triple or however many in the pod) needs to know what\'s expected, what\'s definitely out, and what to negotiate.  I can help couples identify their wants, and their deal-breakers and to respect their lover\'s wants and deal-breakers so they can negotiate agreements that work for their unique needs.

            I am a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and a Certified Internal Family Systems Therapist; I see individuals, couples, and families.  I work primarily with adults age 16 and older. I use the most current evidence-based treatment modalities.  These include, but are not limited to IFS (Internal Family Systems), client-centered therapy, family therapy, and neuro-psychotherapy (guided imagery, meditation, etc.)





            Specialties include: Trauma and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder; Family of Origin Issues; Identity and personal growth; Life events and changes; Couples  and Family Counseling; Polyamorous Relationships; Lifestyle Issues; LGBTQI; Gender and Sexual Identity; Transgender and Transsexual Issues; Alcohol/Drug/Sex Addiction and Recovery; Divorce; Infidelity; Trust and Betrayal; Depression and Anxiety.





            I am a Certified Internal Family Systems therapist.  Internal Family Systems offers a collaborative therapeutic environment that honors each clients unique and intuitive wisdom.  The IFS model of therapy offers a clear, non-pathological, and empowering understanding of human issues.  The goal of therapy is Self-Leadership.

            We also teach tantric practices for polyamorous groups.

            We support and facilitate all relationship choices and help you access your many inner voices' needs, neutral witness and CENTER that embraces all your subselves. We assist you and your lovers and potential lovers in analyzing your bonding patterns with each other so you can make discerning decisions after sharing your vulnerabilities and seeing how you and each of your partners exhibit each others' lesser-developed inner voices. We do phone counseling and run the Harbin Hot Springs California Polyamory conferences.

            I help professional people use more of what they have to get more of what they want.  Specifically, I help businesses and business owners achieve their goals, whatever those goals may be.  Typical issues I can help with include leadership and people development, strategy and business planning, customer loyalty, and time management.

            If you\'re an executive or business owner looking for ways to make your business work better, I\'d love to talk to you and see if I can help.  Real people don\'t leave their lives behind when they go to work.  Having a poly-friendly business coach means having someone you can trust to understand and work through the daily distractions and scheduling challenges, as well as the larger communication and relationship issues that may impact your effectiveness at work.

            I offer personal leadership and time management coaching as well. - Does phone consultation

        description: "I offer therapy and counseling to help individuals and their partners with relationships and communication.  Polyamory may be a framework, but our human needs are still universal - such as connection, love, understanding and trust.  What's different, then?  Identifying and understanding all of the thoughts and feelings that might arise (they are all just part of our human experience), and finding ways to allow them, share them, and hold them with caring.\n\n\n\n\n\nI work with all ages capable of engaging in talk therapy, and with all lifestyles.  I am supportive of whatever individuals decide to co-create together.  However that looks.  I came of age and lived in the Bay Area for so long that I have a sense of the natural variation of human experience that transcends labels and paradigms. \n\n\n\n\n\nMy standard fee is $100 for a 50-minute session.   Sometimes longer sessions are more effective.  It all depends on the situation and the people.  I am a provider with most managed care organizations in the area, and we can speak about how that might work if you want to use health insurance. \n\n\n\n\n\nMy website is a good place to visit if you wish to get a sense of the flavor of who I am, my perspective, and how I work with people.

            I began working in the Mental Health and Chemical Dependency fields in 1981.

            I have worked primarily in community-based, not-for-profit agencies, and have worked as a therapist, a clinical supervisor, a clinical director, and as an administrator at various points throughout my career.

            My theoretical approach to counseling is a Cognitive-Behavioral approach which research has shown to be one of the most effective methods of therapy.  I also utilize a Family Systems approach, and a Jungian approach as appropriate.  I work with individuals, couples, families, and groups.

            I moved to the Portland area in August of 2001, and began my private practice in January, 2002.

            My office is conveniently located at the Portland Insight Meditation Center on a major public transportation route.

            I graduated from Florida State University in 1983 with a Bachelor of Science in Social Work, and in 1987 with a Master of Social Work (clinical).

            I was originally licensed as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in the State of Florida in 1989, and became a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in the State of Oregon in 2001.  I have been continuously licensed in my field since 1989.

            I have worked with many types of issues and people throughout my career, I currently specialize Sexual Minority Issues (LGBTQ), Addictions (Chemical, Behavioral, and Relational), Couple & Family Issues, Abuse & Trauma Issues, Spiritual/Religious Issues, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress, Grief & Loss Issues, Co-dependency and Personal Growth, Family of Origin Issues.

            My style of therapy is one that incorporates asking a lot of questions to help guide clients towards a better understanding of his/her self. Together we explore the impact one\'s past experiences had/have upon your current sense of self. To create a healthier life for oneself, I believe it is important to be aware of one\'s thoughts, feelings and behaviors. This awareness is the first step towards creating a different future.

            I use a multi-systems approach when working with people. In therapy I will explore with an individual or couple the impact of one\'s personal history as it relates to current concerns. One therapy goal is to help client(s) learn how to make informed choices about their lives.

            My speciality is working with individuals and couples who have concerns or questions about sexuality issues. I also work with people who want to learn how to enhance their sexual relationships. First trained as a sexuality educator, I have been working as a sexologist for twenty years.

            Reed Lindberg, M.A., L.P.C., is the Managing Director of the Boulder Psychotherapy Institute. He is a couples therapist with 20 years experience. He refers to his work as \"Relationship, Sex and Romance Counseling,\" and he works with people of all sexual orientations, and feels privileged to share in the inner and interpersonal worlds of his clients and to work with them on their personal and relationship issues.

            Reed works to restore playfulness and trust to a relationship that may have grown mired in everyday life. His therapy is a mutual exploration of a couple\'s issues and strengths. He works with both individuals and couples. Reed offers a free initial session to help see if we will work well together.

            Reed uses an existential perspective supplemented by Gestalt therapy and other approaches. Existential therapy starts from the assumption that we do not have a \"\"static self\"\" and are free to make significant changes in our lives and in the ways that we relate to each other. It encourages each person\'s freedom while building relationship. It works with authenticity. Neither freedom nor connectedness are ignored.

            A therapist must be willing to \"\"go there\"\" with clients if he is to help them extricate themselves from the impact of the past. But he believes that it is the release of creativity and authentic relatedness in the present that is the aim of psychotherapy.

            Reed also works with language and communication to help change the style of a couple\'s dynamics. Resentments and even anger may tinge a couple\'s interactions - a trusted third party, through observation and coaching, can help modify the words and attitudes that bring frustration to a relationship.

            To understand, respect, and be present to the lived reality of others is one of the great privileges of living in relationship and of being a psychotherapist.

            My commitment to my clients is to provide a healthy and healing relational environment to grow more fully into who they want to be. The framework I hold is very relational. Relationships are the context to which we grow our psyche. We often are solely focused on what our relationships provide for our current or imminent needs. Beneath the surface of the immediate is a deeper development of who we are and how we view ourselves and the world around us. My goal is to increase your awareness of your thought patterns, and ultimately to strengthen your choice and influence over these patterns.





            Practically speaking, I help people from all walks of life and world views. My goal is to empower you to be present and confident with who you are and how you interact with others. I help people customize their way of being and relationships.

        description: |-
            I affirm the fundamental goodness of sexuality in human life, both as a personal need and as an interpersonal bond. I know the unhappiness and anxiety, which sex-negative attitudes can engender in individuals, alienating them from their own body and the bodies of others. I know that such attitudes affect not only a person's sex life, but also his/her ability to relate well with others.

            Sexual wellbeing is more than simply being able to perform. It is also taking responsibility for one's eroticism as an integral part of one's personality and involvement with others. Between the extremes of total sexual repression and relentless sexual pursuit, a person can find that unique place, where he/she is free to live a life of self-respect, enjoyment and love.

            Each person is a special ensemble of dispositions and needs and his/her uniqueness must be respected. My aim is to provide such information and guidance as will help the individual approach his/her unique sexuality in a realistic and responsible manner, as well as further his/her independent growth, personal integrity, and have a more joyful experience of living. - Does online consultation - Does phone consultation

        description: The nature of life is to grow. We honor this most fundamental law of nature through our relationships. But without this understanding in relationship situations, we wrongly mistake the impulse to grow as a problem, rooted in past fearful memories, projected into an imagined future. Having the knowledge, tools and courage to own our individual interior reality, is imperative for healthy relationships. Learn how to love and support one another in staying identified with the Self, making peace with and resolving Egoic fears, and consciously create the loving relationships you deserve. I have been a Psychotherapist for ten years and practicing polyamory for five. I provide a free short phone consultation for prospective clients. I also offer Relationship Coaching, Parenting Education and Support, and Introductory Meditation Instruction.

        description: Published researcher on highly sexual women. I have been a professional counselor/therapist for 30 years. I am knowledgeable about and accepting of a wide variety of alternative lifestyles including poly and BDSM. I am comfortable working with both relationship and individual issues of all sorts with clients of any sexual orientation and any lifestyle. In addition to therapy, as a sexologist I can provide coaching/counseling for sexual enhancement, that is, assisting couples in learning to extend and enhance their pleasure. My practice primarily involves using Cognitive Therapy on a short term basis to assist clients in learning to think differently and live more satisfying lives. At least a third of clients coming to see me have issues related to anxiety and panic disorder, including physical ailments that are stress related. Other common issues (in addtion to relationship conflicts)include anger management, depression, and substance abuse.

        description: |-
            Poly relationships can be profoundly fulfilling if our communication skills are up to the task and our own issues do not get in the way. I know, because I have been poly for over 35 years, and have been counseling poly folks for over 30 years. I work with individuals, couples, triads, quads and moresomes, with the goal of helping everyone feel heard and deeply understood by the others in the relationship. Poly is one possible lovestyle out of many, and I believe it is important to help each person find their own personal best way to love.





            I also work with:





            * those who are initially exploring poly and do not yet know if they are poly or not,


            * poly/mono couples where one person is poly and the other monogamous


            * couples where someone cheated and now would like to rebuild trust in an open relationship





            I wrote **The Polyamory Communication Survival Kit,**, available at http://www.robertmcgarey.com/Site/Poly_Kit.html, and I have been for years a frequent presenter at national poly conferences on the East Coast, the West Coast and everywhere in between. I believe you will find me knowledgeable, insightful, compassionate and non-judgmental. You are invited to schedule a free, half-hour introductory session to get a feel for the kind of work we can do together. Sessions are also available by phone or internet. Sessions are normally $120 for a full 60-minute hour, but if that is not in your ballpark then a sliding scale is available.

            Are you in emotional pain? Are you depressed and lacking in self esteem? Upset with your relationships or partner/s? I am a gay and poly affirming psychotherapist and, you don\'t have to feel this way. Therapy can help you end the pain. Seeking counseling is not a sign of weakness, nor does it imply that you lack the ability to function as a balanced person. Actually, it is a sign of strength to recognize you may need to work on certain issues. Lets work together to make the changes you want a reality.

            People seek therapy because they feel like they are not living the life they want. Do you have the life you desire? I offer caring and supportive psychotherapy. With a special heart for creative and poly individuals. You can transform and I am dedicated to your achievement of that success.

            We will approach your challenges holistically and collaboratively. I offer over six years of clinical and teaching experience. The celebration of diversity is a guiding principal behind my work. Individuals, partners and polyamerious are welcome. I am looking forward to working with you. Call today to schedule your session.

I also work with people who are in creative relationship structures including open relationship, and have a special interest in sexual concerns, lifestyle and kink activity. I often see my best contribution as simply asking useful questions. I work especially well with people who are intellectually gifted. I work at both offices.

        description: I enjoy work with people who are dealing with addictions, or who are affected by the alcohol and drug use of people they care about. I work well with people who are navigating through anxiety and depression, and find cognitive-behavioral therapy, which brings together your thoughts, feelings and day-to-day attitudes and activities is often useful. I have extensive training and experience in work with couples of all compositions and orientations on improving communication, issues of trust and infidelity, and decisions about relationships. I also enjoy teens and families.

        description: I work with couples, whether they are simply looking to improve their communication, or wondering if they can find a way to stay together and be happy. I have extensive experience working with individual clients who are in high-stress careers, including medical professionals. I have worked with complex situations involving bereavement and loss, and have been in the field of psychology for over twenty years. I provide strengths-based treatment, meaning the kind of counseling that works with people's natural ability for growth and change. I have had significant training on varied cultural groups and diverse lifestyles. I see clients downtown in the evenings, and Saturdays at SE office.

        description: Through my training and experience, I have discovered that healing of mind, body, and spirit truly come from within. Our job is to assist people in finding balance so that true self-healing can take place. So often this means simply creating kind, welcoming opportunities for people to feel their feelings and examine their relationships. But I also think that there are internal mechanisms for healing -- potentials within each of us. Whether you are seeking assistance in healing imbalance in physical, emotional, or relationship parts of your life, I believe you can experience remarkable movement toward greater health and happiness. I am at the downtown office.

        description: I have been providing individual, family and group counseling for more than two decades, to clients ranging in age from two to 101. Most of us are challenged by transition and change; breaking out of old beliefs and behaviors (even when they are no longer working well) and establishing new ones is not easy. Whether doing counseling with adults or play therapy with children, I strive to work collaboratively, and to balance the use of listening and support with actively offering ideas and strategies. In addition to helping clients reach their counseling goals, my aim is to offer them tools and skills that will continue to be useful long after they have left my office.

        description: Open, Honest and Direct Psychotherapy and Life Coaching An open, honest and direct work space is what we need to explore and gain a deeper understanding of why we think/feel and do the things we do. Through this process we begin to learn new things about ourselves and the world we live in. It is this new perspective that allows us to make different decisions and make our visions a reality. Why live life on someone elses road, when you can take control of your own? Walking a mile in someone elses shoes just takes you a mile away ... in shoes that do not fit. So instead, lets start from the beginning. Therapy is a specialized and unique space which everyone has a right to, no matter their circumstances. In this economy, more than ever it is important to have access to this resource. I believe in therapy being an accessible space both economically and personally. From the business of the relationship to the work being done, it is a space shaped yours and your therapists needs. - Does online consultation - Does phone consultation

I work with adult individuals, and have experience in poly, kink, trans*, gamer, and other communities that tend to have poly connections. I graduated from Smith College SSW, training in New Mexico and Boston. After several years working at a small non-profit psychiatric clinic practicing therapy, directing programs, and supervising trainees, I moved to a private practice in 2009. I also volunteer as a psychiatric evaluator for folks seeking asylum into the US. For a bit more about how I work, costs, and insurance info, visit http://www.thelm.net (clients tell me they dig the pizza metaphor). When I am not practicing therapy, I also work as a professional chef.

            The central goal of The Intimacy Institute Institute is to help clients enhance sexual function, pleasure, and knowledge of human sexuality, individually and in relationship.
            Because sexual experiences often take place in the context of relationships, we also blend the best practices in couples and marital therapy with sex therapy techniques.

            The Intimacy Institute is open and affirming to all people regardless of race, ethnicity, culture, ability, age, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, gender, religious or political beliefs, and/or alternative forms of sexual expression and lifestyle. We also work kinky, transgender, and HIV+ populations. In addition, we have a male sex therapist who speaks Spanish.

My approach is sex positive and nonjudgmental, and I encourage my clients to focus on pleasure rather than performance.  My belief is that each human being deserves a full and satisfying sexual life.  My intention is to help clients discover what is the sex life they want, and assist them in achieving their goals.  For more information, please visit my website or feel free to call me.

I also have a specialty in providing empirically supported treatment for anxiety disorders (PTSD, OCD, phobias, social anxiety, etc.). With respect to gender and sexuality, the bulk of my work is with individuals exploring their gender identity and/or navigating gender transition. I provide psychotherapeutic support for this, as well as assessments for letters of eligibility for beginning puberty blockers, hormone therapy, or gender surgeries. A slightly smaller % of my clientele are generally those in the GLBIQQP area of the sexuality spectrum, as well as individuals who identify as poly or kinky. Some clients come to me for help with issues directly related to a polyamorous relationship, others see me for unrelated matters but want to see a therapist who is poly-affirming.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Not on any insurance panels but accept cash, check, credit cards, and my billing service sends automatic statements once a month that makes submitting for out of network reimbursement (if applicable) slightly easier\n\n\n- Risk free 90 minute initial consultation (no charge if you decide it is not a good fit, $275 if it is a good fit and we proceed to work together) \n\n\n- $180/50 min session \n\n\n- Initial sessions are always in person. Following that, I can at times offer phone/online sessions via a HIPAA compliant platform for remote sessions if needed."

        description: 'As a somatic coach and sex educator, I help people who are not satisfied with their sex lives whether because something is not working or because they see the possibility of more. I am very poly supportive; my partner and I know well the value of deepening our intimacy as we play with others. Author of The Whole Lesbian Sex Book (Cleis Press). The term somatic comes from the Greek word soma, meaning the living body in its wholeness--muscles, tissue, emotions, thoughts, breath, movement, sensations, language. When you have sex, you bring with you the whole package of who you are: your sexual history, your beliefs about sex and gender, your accumulated sexual wisdom, your erotic imagination and yearnings, and your physical structure, including armoring that may impede your ability to feel genital sensation by restricting the flow of energy through your pelvis and legs. My work addresses all of these aspects from the viewpoint of the clients deepest concerns. What do you want? What is missing now? Where are you stuck? What new competencies do you need to develop to reach your goals? I combine sex education with somatic bodywork (fully clothed). We use breathwork, self-observation, and simple movement exercises to guide you toward the new skills, practices, and perspectives that would have you say that you are thoroughly delighted with your sex life. I work with clients in my San Francisco/Bay Area studio and by phone. - Does phone consultation'

Whether it is a relationship issue, a career issue, challenges with depression, anxiety, or substance use, we can find ourselves repeating the same patterns.

I have a special focus in my practice on the LGBTQ Community and extensive experience working with people in polyamorous and open relationships.  I am also Kink/BDSM friendly.

            I blend various methods of psychotherapy (humanistic/interpersonal, existential, cognitive-behavioral, systems, psychodynamic, and others) and mind-body approaches in a compassionate, safe, and respectful environment.

            By examining how past experiences shape current functioning, we can begin to explore new options. I help people to develop greater self-awareness, free themselves from limiting patterns, find comfort through self-acceptance, and discover the path to greater authenticity and fulfillment.

I counsel children of any age and families of any type, including step-families, blended families, adoptive families, and families of choice. My particular focus is on providing counseling for people in any kind of intimate relationship(s): gay, straight, bisexual, closed, open, egalitarian, hierarchical, coupled, or of more than two people. Definitions may be fluid, nonexistent, or to-be-determined--counseling is a space in which to address these questions, along with any others that my clients consider to be meaningful. My other specialties are domestic violence work (with offenders and victims), wedding and commitment ceremony officiating, writing-as-healing workshops, and vocational testing and counseling.'

        description: Although my background is in Clinical Psychology, I consider myself a relationship coach and spiritual friend rather than a psychotherapist who helps individuals become more aware of what they want, how to navigate sexual and relationship issues, and how to communicate their needs and preferences to others. I have nearly 30 years of experience with polyamorous relationships and can usually help people get unstuck with only a few sessions. I have no opinion about what form of relationship individuals should choose, but rather support people to learn what\'s appropriate for them. - Does phone consultation

        description: "Polyamory is the practice, desire, or acceptance of having more than one intimate relationship at a time with the knowledge and consent of everyone involved with an emphasis on ethics, honesty, and transparency all around. It is important to differentiate the polyamory lifestyle from swinging. While they share consensual, ethical, and responsible sexual behavior, swinging is largely driven by sexual, ego, and social desires for sharing good times with like-minded friends-with-benefits; or, as Tina Turner famously sang: What\\'s Love Got to Do With It? \n\nPersonal integrity, communication skills and dynamics, attitudes, beliefs, financial issues, and personal chemistry are just a few of the issues that can interfere in any relationship. My work with individuals, couples, and groups is oriented toward resolving the underlying issues that interfere with their lifestyle objectives. This work is an ongoing process for any poly-pod as the issues are dynamic and ever changing. \n\nI encourage everyone to assume every relationship is subject to the basic stages of group development: Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing. While the latter is the ideal and desired outcome and can indeed be the starting place under the right circumstances, for most it only takes place through concerted effort and willingness to adapt for the common good. \n\nI have worked within individuals, couples, and pods in both the swinging and poly-lifestyles since the mid-eighties. My work is always directed toward the least common denominator - YOU! What can you do? What do you want? What is your challenge? What are your needs, drives, behaviors, etc. How are you helping, hurting, promoting, destroying what you want? What are you going to do differently? \n\nI use a variety of tools and techniques from an array of backgrounds and stand ready and prepared to assist your lifestyle and relationship and personal needs and desires. I invite you to pay attention to your tension and contact me before it rises to stress or falls to apathy as both are clear indicators of impending doom and loss. \n\nAbout me:\nFor the credential-obsessed, I am not a licensed psychologist or relationship counselor. \nI am certified in several rapid change therapies and a member of multiple associations for integrated healing. \nI am a member of Mensa with formal degrees and certifications in Psychology, Communications, and Engineering. \nI am empowered with successful learning experiences in swinging, poly, and communal living lifestyles.\nI am a Spiritual Counselor and Minister of the Spirit who embraces all paths to health, compassion, and love.\nI am a practitioner of meta-medicine and member of the International Meta_Medicine Association.\nI am a founding member of the International Coaching Association and other professional groups. - Does online consultation - Does phone consultation"

        description: "Annie is your coach if you want to:\n*Meet the right people\n*Connect deeply with the people you meet\n*Understand what your dates want & how to express what you are looking for\n*Move through the dating process, find the right one and build a lasting love\n*Learn problem solving and stop arguing\n*Create pathways to understanding\n*Find your way to the Peaceful Passion you both/all desire\n*Create a life together with intention and clarity\n*Learn for the first time what it can be like to love someone on purpose\n*Stop arguing & create understanding & collaboration\n*Discover the human potential you have as a team\n*Create a plan for making your relationship last\n*Rediscover the passion that brought you together\n*Grow together to ever increasing levels of intimacy and joy\n*Learn for the first time what it can be like to love someone on purpose\n*Trust your own heart & feel safe loving again\n*Reconnect to a belief you\\'ve questioned because of loss\n*Create a place within to hold your memories in a way that doesn\\'t hold you back\n*Understand what happened to your past relationships & let go so you can move forward\n*Come to terms with a love that didn\\'t end well\n\nAnnie is a seasoned consultant and an expert on the dating process and the\ndating industry. She brings years of experience and a deep understanding of\nthe differences between men and women to her coaching. Annie will work with you to set quantifiable goals, develop an action plan to move forward quickly, remove negative belief systems and create a powerful program to maximize your exposure to potential partners. You will learn to screen potential partners more effectively, locate and recognize your soul mates and move smoothly and quickly through the 5 stages of dating. \n\nEach stage of relationship has it's own challenges and rewards. Are you and your partner ready to move to the next stage? Do you have uncertainties? Does your partner? Do you know where to go next and how you are going to get there together? Are you ready to plan a future together with intention and clarity? Annie will help you create a map to the future you want to share with your partner.\n\nLearn problem solving, create pathways to understanding, discover the human potential you have as a team, find your way to the peaceful passion you both desire. Create a life together with intention and clarity. Learn for the first time what it can be like to love someone on purpose.\n\nWe each dream of relationship that is passionate, joyful and tender. Often we find ourselves frustrated, very much in love, yet unable to create the love we dreamed of, resentful and angry with the one/s we love most.\n\nAs we grieve the loss of a love, our grief can feel like all we have to hold onto. Our memories, and our thoughts of the future, can be hard to hold alongside one another. How do we begin to move forward while still honoring the past? How do know we when it is time? Such a loss, even when expected, can leave us devastated and unclear of the future.\n\nWhat Is Relationship Coaching?\nRelationship coaching is a professional client-focused service where an individual or couple is assumed to be healthy, powerful, and able to achieve relationship goals with effective support, information, and guidance.\n \nCoaching:\n-Assumes the client is whole\n-Roots in sports, business, personal\n  growth venues\n-Works to move people to a higher level\n  of functioning\n-Focuses on actions and the future\n-Focuses on solving problems\n-Works with the conscious mind\n-Works for external solutions to\n  overcome barriers, learn new skills\n  and implement effective choices  \n\nTherapy:\n-Assumes the client needs healing\n-Roots in medicine, psychiatry-Works\n  with people to achieve self-\n  understanding and emotional healing\n-Focuses on feelings and past events\n-Explores the root of problems\n-Works to bring the unconscious into\n  consciousness\n-Works for internal resolution of pain and\n  to let go of old patterns\n\n \nTop 10 Guidelines Of Relationship Coaching\n\n1. Relationship Coaching is not consulting or therapy.\nCoaching empowers by assuming our clients are the expert, fully capable of achieving their goals, and focuses on supporting them into action based on personal values as defined by the client. Consulting typically provides advice and solutions, while therapy typically focuses on insight and emotional issues. Because these approaches are so different, the coach should be clear about these distinctions, educate clients about them, and make conscious choices about the nature of the coaching relationship that are in the best interests of our clients.\n\n2. A Relationship Coach helps the client focus on the bigger picture.\nRelationship coaching is not effective when isolating our clients' relationship goals from the rest of their life, such as work, family, friends, wellness, spirituality, etc.\n\n3. A Relationship Coach shares relationship knowledge, experience, and information without attachment.\nSharing expertise with our clients as a coach is very different from any other helping relationship. It is necessary to address our clients' relationship skills and knowledge deficits, however we do so in a way that supports them to discover and own their truth.\n\n4. A Relationship Coach assumes a relationship is part of the journey, not the destination.\nWe support our clients to focus on meaning, connection, and long-term goals, in addition to helping them find a partner or improve their existing relationships.\n\n5. A Relationship Coach assumes that the most important relationship is the one you have with yourself.\nOur relationships are our mirrors. The Law Of Attraction dictates that what is inside shows up on the outside. We help our clients take responsibility for their relationship outcomes and be the partner they want to have.\n\n6. A Relationship Coach does not judge a relationship as right or wrong, good or bad.\nAs stated above, we assume our clients are the expert and honor their truth and agenda. While we have judgments, we do not impose them on our clients. We lead our clients through a process of discovery in which they are empowered to make the relationship choices that are right for them.\n\n7. A Relationship Coach does not seek to get personal needs met with clients or prospective clients.\nAn ethical coach values being of service above all else, holds the coaching relationship sacred, and does not allow a personal agenda to interfere with doing so.\n\n8. A Relationship Coach addresses their clients' sabotaging attitudes and choices without making them wrong.\nWe skillfully help our clients become aware of the connection between their attitudes (beliefs, interpretations, etc), choices and consequences, and support them to make their own judgments and decisions about them in light of their Vision, Purpose, Requirements, Needs, and Goals.\n\n9. A Relationship Coach is neutral about the outcome for pre-committed relationships, and an advocate for committed relationships.\nWe value using the opportunity while single to make conscious long-term relationship choices, and believe in the power and necessity of commitment to make those choices work and be fulfilling.\n\n10. A Relationship Coach \"walks the talk\" by continually addressing his or her own personal and relationship development, challenges, and goals.\nWe know that we can only help our clients along paths that we have traveled ourselves, and no further, so we must continually strive to be conscious and intentional in our lives and relationships. This includes furthering our own learning and development by working with a coach or mentor, on-going training, and other means. - Does online consultation - Does phone consultation"

            Counseling Approach & Philosophy
            I approach counseling with a holistic assumption of the interconnectedness of body, mind and spirit.  I also assume that there is an innate tendency for clients to grow towards health and wholeness.  Rather than labeling old patterns a pathologies, I prefer to recognize them as coping strategies developed as a part of the individual's attempts for safety and health, which may now be obsolete.  In my work I focus on helping clients identify both those patterns that may be holding them back and the skills and resources they have available to become more choice-full in their lives.

            I utilize a mindful, body-centered experiential and relational approach.  I also pay attention to the systemic nature of interpersonal interaction in relationships and families.  Through attention to present moment experience, comes the discovery of beliefs, thoughts, feelings, memories and images that impact daily life in both positive and negative ways.  The awareness and corrective emotional experiences in therapy support building resources and adopting more effective patterns.

        description: I am a relationship therapist in Fort Collins who works with couples and individuals who are struggling with intimacy issues.  Some couples discover that polyamory and similar open arrangements can be both rewarding and challenging as they work to establish rules of fidelity in their partnership.  In our work together, we will explore current concerns, and we may look at the erotic blueprints of childhood that can impact your intimate relationships. I will also provide practical, solution focused tools to help you get your intimate life back on track.  I am friendly and affirming of all forms of sexual expression and look forward to helping you create an open, loving partnership.

My clients speak of feeling supported, understood, and empowered. I have seen real change take place in my clients lives. I have heard from my counseling clients that coming to therapy and working with me has been life-changing, truly life-saving, and powerful. How is this possible? I believe that the success lies in the integrity and commitment of our therapeutic bond. I earnestly care about helping my clients find a more joyful and healthy life.  I have specialties in helping adults with Aspergers and bereaved parents and families, and I welcome and enjoy working with poly, kink, and GLBQT clients. I look forward to learning more from each of my therapy clients as together we walk and learn.

        description: Andrew came to polyamory through marriage, opening his marriage in 2001 with his out poly wife guiding and consciously exploring responsible poly-relationships with joy ever since.  Having transformed a lifetime of very possessive, jealous relationship dynamics within himself, Andrew has great compassion and specific expertise in the traditionally minded interested (or terrified!) in opening themselves and their relationships. He has been a stand for the last 9 years in others getting access great relationships in their lives. He uses the wisdom of polyamory as a guide to gain perspective on those things that constrain the freedom and love that inhibit each of us to grow freely in our love lives. Please email or call to schedule a free 20 minute intake call to see if Andrew is a good fit for coaching sessions! - Does online consultation - Does phone consultation

            My first goal as a therapsit is to offer non-judgmental, non-pathologizing support. All clients deserve to be heard and respected, no matter what their relationship choices. I work best with people who have had an experience of being \"outside the norm\", and personally celebrate what makes all of us different.

            I specialize in working with poly/kinky/asexual clients in my private practice. As a student of human sexuality and anthropology, I understand also the challenges faced by people who undertake monogamy. I also enjoy working with artists, as I am an artist myself, and utilize creative writing and art therapy techniques to help clients better understand and relate to their experience.

            I believe that each person is the author of their own experience. No matter what your path has been in your life, your experience is unique to you, and I respect the individuality of your story and your emotions.

            Please feel free to email or call if you have any questions about my work. I look forward to hearing from you!

        description: "VortexHealing® - www.vortexhealing.org - works with Divine Healing Energy, Magic, and Divine Consciousness.   \n\nVortex Healing is similar to Reiki where divine healing energy is channeled through a person into the receiver.  Vortex Healing becomes different however because it also works directly from divine consciousness. Divine Consciousness is the highest healing vibration you can ever experience. It literally heals and transforms the illusion of separation from the Divine.  Any disharmony or trauma within your system; physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and even karmic can be healed on its deepest level. During a session you receive very sophisticated VortexHealing® techniques coming from many divine energetic levels and frequencies simultaneously. Frequencies range from the very light and gentle to the tremendously deep and intense. This works with the rule that there are many levels and dimensions to our consciousness. These levels contain the deepest and hardest to reach levels of negative conditioning. VortexHealing® reaches ALL these levels! \n\nRelease of these blockages promotes the greatest acceleration of change and transformation. A few VortexHealing® sessions equal the amount of healing work that may take months or even years to accomplish with other therapies. I say with the utmost confidence that when you walk out of one of my sessions you will leave a transformed soul. - Does phone consultation"

            We help the media for print, radio, film, television and internet find polyamorous people who are willing and interested in participating in media events, such as news articles, interviews, talk shows, documentaries, and more! We can get the media in contact with those specific types of people being focused on in time for those important deadlines. We also offer resources to average poly folk to help prepare for media coverage, including how to make sure everyone is treated fairly.

            We also have qualified public speakers for lectures and workshops for colleges, churches, conventions, and any organization who is interested in education about polyamory in the form of lectures, panels, and workshops. We can help researchers gather people for surveys and studies about alternative sexualities. We work with folks who practice polyamory, responsible non-monogamy, open marriages, open relationships, triads, quads, networks, tribes, swingers, and those who don\'t choose any label but prefer a nontraditional relationship style. - Does online consultation

        description: "\"My life, and yours, is a dance between destiny and freedom\"\n      --Sam Keen\n\nI have successfully worked with adolescents and adults from a wide variety of walks of life since 2000, and can attest to the fact that what people often refer to as \"destiny\" is frequently created by them through their beliefs and patterns of interacting with themselves and the world. Changing these set ways not only helps individuals to find a better solutions to problems they are facing, whether it is in their personal life or business, but also attain freedom from burdens of the past. \n\nSome of the problem areas I specialized in include: life-stage and professional transitions, grief and loss, abuse, PTSD, dissociative disorders, OCD, anxiety, depression, body image issues, eating disorders, sexuality, addictions, self-injury, relationship problems, spiritual and existential dilemmas/crises.\n\nI work with individuals, couples, and groups. I am fluent in Ukrainian, Russian, and can also communicate in Polish and Spanish. My therapy approach is multifaceted and highly interactive; in it, I emphasize the importance of self-awareness, inner reflection, and the essential need to balance the mind, body, and spirit. In our work the twists and turns that come your way will transform into an adventure of SELF-discovery, necessary for you to reach your highest potential. - Does phone consultation"

I provide individual and couples therapy, and work with couples in all kinds of relationship configurations. My other specialty includes cross-cultural issues and I enjoy working with people of diverse backgrounds and ethnicities.

            Psychotherapy with adults and adolescents who primarily seek help for issues regarding sexuality (orgasm/desire/pain/erectile dysfunction/confidence/trust/boundaries/insert other problem here...), gender, kink (kink knowledgeable), relationships, sexual abuse... the list goes on. Couples, poly constellations, individuals, groups - whatever floats your boat, everyone's welcome (unless you have a serious drug/alcohol problem you need to resolve elsewhere first - after which you're also welcome). Therapies in Norwegian or English (I understand Swedish and Danish). Online sessions possible in special cases, but only after a minimum of two live meetings.





            NOK 1000/45min session individual therapy,1200 for sessions involving more than 1. 4-5 and above is considered a group, fee as mutually agreed upon and double sessions strongly recommended). Long term or short term therapies as needed. If you qualify for a specific type of long term psychotherapy I specialize in (a character analytical approach), and agree to the terms involved, a reduced fee may be available.

        description: Russell Wilkie, MA, MFT, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Relationships and how we communicate are the two most important things in our lives - - and I find it even more so in poly relationships. I have spent over 20 years working with LGBTQ and poly issues. I focus on using clear communication to refine and clarify intimacy, honesty, love, directness and sex... How we communicate and sooth one anothers emotional reactivity has more to do with quality relationships than focusing on our deep, dark, past issues. Choosing a therapist is like choosing shoes -- You may have to try some on before you find one that fits.

I believe that a persons spiritual journey has a tremendous effect on their life and so I have made a point to study world religions so that I can meet a variety of clients where they are on their path whether it includes a spiritual tradition or not. \n\nI pride myself on working with families of all kinds including alternative families. I have experience with the GLBTQ community as well as polyamorous families. When you\\'re not monogamous, sometimes the issues aren\\'t about polyamory or your alternative lifestyle. Having a poly friendly counselor helps keep the focus on the real issues. I also work with mixed relationships (polyamorous/monogomous). Families come in many shapes and sizes and unfortunately many counselors are only trained in working with traditional and nuclear families. I believe it is important to understand the dynamics that come into play in many cultures and traditions and how it effects the family unit as a whole.\n\nAlternative Sexualities and Lifestyles are another area I chose to specialize in for I believe there is a lack of resources available. Sexual variance, fringe communities, alternative living arrangements; all of these are often misunderstood and judged. While working with these communities I provide a safe, non-judgmental space to explore issues related and unrelated to one\\'s alternative way of self-expression."

            People often tell me they want a therapist who will both listen AND have something to say. I believe that emotional safety and good communication must be established in order for therapy to be successful.  From the first session, I try to provide a safe environment where you can fully experience your feelings and look at things you want to change. Aside from listening to you, I will ask a lot of questions as we attempt to look at your problems from a fresh perspective.

            I am especially interested in helping people work through relationship problems.  I have specialized training as a couples/relationship therapist, and I believe that there are many ways to have a relationship.  Diversity is important to me, and I want to work with a wide range of people from all walks of life.

        description: 'As a psychotherapist, I am committed to supporting adults, couples, partners, families and groups in feeling more alive, connected and authentic in their relationships with themselves, others and their communities. I believe that each of us is already whole, and that there is a wealth of knowledge alive within us just waiting for our awareness and appreciation. Our bodies are one way to access this inner wisdom, and my work encourages us to explore and celebrate what our bodies have to teach us about our innate capacities for healing, growth and transformation.

        fees: Sliding scale based on income, life circumstance, systemic, and environmental factors. You can find my updated sliding scale on my website and ask me about how we can determine your specific fee.
        description: At my practice Divergent Worlds I provide psychotherapy for adults, young adults, and relationships; supervision for associates; and clinical consultations. I approach this work with a collaborative style, supporting people as they engage in their therapy experience. I provide non-judgmental supportive therapy for people with a range of sexual, relationship, and gender identities and experiences, including LGBTQIQA2S, BDSM, sexual variations, furries, non-monogamy, non binary gender and gender fluidity, and sex workers. I specialize in working through sexuality/gender/relationship related concerns, and supporting these folks with the other aspects of their inner and outer worlds. In my practice and in my world, I acknowledge and work to address systematic and environmental barriers and oppression, and I strive to build a practice and a therapeutic space that includes all aspects of your world. I focus on trauma recovery, body image, disability, impulse control, depression, anxiety, creating boundaries, self esteem, empowerment, substance abuse, adaptive coping skills, and relationships.  I believe that therapy should be accessible for everybody who wants it. As part of my efforts to increase access to supportive services, I use a sliding scale and accept Medi-Cal. Please feel free to contact me for more information or to schedule an appointment.

            I believe that people have the desire and capacity to heal and grow. I also believe that our quality of life is significantly impacted by our relationship with others. Because of that, my counseling practice primarily focuses on work around intimacy, relationships and sexuality.

            Please check my website for current groups. Potential groups include: \"How\'s Your Sex Life?\", \"Exploring Non-monogamy\" and \"Deepening Intimacy in a Long Term Relationship.\"

            I have experience working with queer and trans identified clients.

        description: "It is an honor to sit with a client in the quiet container of the psychotherapy experience.  My goal is to offer you a safe relationship which provides the relief and understanding necessary for emotional vitality.  With intuition as well as understanding I listen for ways I can help you both manage and transform painful feelings and situations.  In our work together, you can expect that I will actively share thoughts for reflection as well as practical ideas.  My goal is to help you to find clarity, purpose and meaning in both the past and the future.   \n\nNon-monogamy offers opportunities for growth when agreements and boundaries are productively managed. \nAs most therapists are influenced by a culture who views monogamy as the only viable option for committed relationships, it is important to work with a therapist that is both knowledgeable and supportive of alternative possibilities.   All partners viewpoints must be heard and respected for non-monogamy to be successful.   My work with clients supports both individuals and couples exploring this path."

            I offer childbirth education (Brio Birth and other classes) and labor support (doula services) to women and families in central and eastern Massachusetts.

            I teach a comprehensive course (24 hours of instruction) which covers:  how the body works during pregnancy; how to eat and exercise to keep your baby healthy; various choices in care providers and places of birth; many different ways to relax; what the parts of labor look like, and how to support a laboring mom; how to work effectively with your partner and your birth team; the aftermath of birth; nursing your baby; and taking care of your newly expanded family.  For more information on my classes and my labor-support services, please see my Web site.

            I welcome expectant parents in all kinds of families, from single moms to same-sex couples to poly arrangements, as well as those in more traditional relationships!

            I have been a professional massage therapist since 1993. Most of my training has been through Harbin Hot Springs School of Shiatsu and Massage.  I have studied a variety of modalities and combine them uniquely and intuitively to best suit each individual and each session. I have the ability to work very deeply while maintaining a very fluid and nurturing touch. I offer both a Swedish/Esalen/Deep Tissue-based table massage and a Shiatsu/Yogassage/Joint Release floor massage.





            I look froward to supporting you in your relaxation and pain relief needs.

I help clients better understand the influence of interconnected thoughts, feelings, stories, values, and expectations on conscious and subconscious behaviors and decision-making patterns. I can also help reconnect them with the strengths and resources available to, and within, themselves in times of crisis.

        description: "I'm a certified birth and postpartum doula that works in the Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti area. I've always been passionate about women being able to choose what works best for themselves and their families, and I'm excited to have the opportunity to assist families as they evolve and grow.  The doula's role of support, facilitating informed consent and fostering independence and confidence of the parents is what I want my life's work to be.  I base my actions as a doula on the philosophy that women can and should be trusted to make choices about their bodies and pregnancy, and will find what works best for their family.  I work as both a birth and a postpartum doula to be able to provide the best continuity of care I am capable of.\n\nAs a birth doula, I assist women with non-medical physical support and emotional support through their active labour and delivery, and can provide some basic breastfeeding assistance.  I can assist labour partners in learning comfort measures and will assist families in getting settled with their new member.  \n\nAs a postpartum doula, I offer practical support, emotional support, non-judgmental listening, and good old fashioned mothering of the brand new mother.  The extra hands to soothe mother and baby also help the family foster a sense of independence and self-confidence that lasts long after the doula's stay with the family is over.  I am certified in Adult, Child and Infant CPR and First Aid."

            I am Board certified as a Sex Therapist by numerous professional organizations. I am licensed in California by the Board of Behavioral Sciences as a Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT), and in British Columbia as a Registered Clinical Counsellor (RCC). I have practiced since 1966. I work with people of all sexual orientations and relationship configurations who have sexual questions ranging from difficulties to enhancement.





            I affirm my commitment to personal, consensual, sexual rights and choices, gender equality and personal responsibility, and to the autonomy and empowerment of people regardless of gender or sexual orientation or expression. All individuals, couples and families have the right to decide, freely and responsibly, what part they want sexuality to play in their relationships. I have worked with many poly and kink couples and families.





            Many clients are now being seen via Skype.

            I believe that change is possible. I have a holistic approach to counseling, taking into account the complex dynamic between mind and body. In addition to the traditional form of talk therapy, my work includes techniques such as therapeutic breathwork, hypnotherapy, meditation, couples facilitation, life coaching, and spiritual counseling. I specialize in intimacy and sexual issues, recovering from or managing health conditions, Fibromyalgia and other \"invisible\" disabilities, trauma and PTSD, depression, low self image/self esteem, and addictive behaviors. I am also trained in an energy work style that is similar to Reiki.

            I work with individuals, couples, families and groups; all ages, as well as all gender identities, sexual orientations, and alternative lifestyle choices. I look forward to helping you make the transformation in your life that you desire. - Does online consultation - Does phone consultation

            The goal of my practice is to help you feel better and accept yourself; not just by addressing anxiety and depression and avoiding the things that feel bad but also by engaging with what brings you pleasure, joy and a sense of connection. This can be through an exploration of sexuality or through whatever you find in your life that makes you feel passionate and alive.





            In my office, you will find that difference is not just accepted but celebrated.





            I work with individuals and people in relationships to develop a loving, accepting and kind method of communication with each other. Together we can change behaviors, resolve issues, improve sexual functioning, manage anxiety, depression and other complex feelings and cope better with pain and suffering.





            Working together is always a unique experience customized to your needs. I have experience using psychodynamic, mindfulness, Imago and cognitive behavioral approaches to therapy and I try to choose the methodology that suits best for the individuals in my office.





            I have a special interest in supporting people through issues related to sexual exploration, sexual functioning, sexual identity and gender identity. Clients who are in non-monogamous relationships, swinger, polyamorous and/or kink relationships are welcome.

        description: Northampton Sex Therapy Associates (NSTA), is a private group practice of licensed, experienced sex therapists who provide psychotherapy to people wishing to increase their sexual self-esteem and confidence, reawaken desire and love in relationships, improve communication about sex and intimacy, and increase emotional connections and a stronger sense of personal eroticism through sexual intimacy. NSTA provides evidence-based sex and relationship therapy, sexuality counseling and education to individuals, couples and poly/non-monogamous relationships and also specializes in sexuality and gender identity issues across the spectrum of sexual functioning and sexual orientation. Some of the common sexual concerns that we treat are loss of physical intimacy for many reasons; loss of desire; inability to relax and enjoy oneself; obsessive-compulsive sexual behavior (sometimes called sexual addiction); erectile or ejaculatory difficulties; sexual identity; gender identity; problems with orgasm; vaginismus (contractions of the vagina that prevent penetration); sex-related pain; trauma; and conflicts in relationships over sexual values, attitudes, or behaviors. We can provide both online and phone consultations in California and Massachusetts.

Challenges commonly encountered include new partners figuring out just what type of relationship they want to create together, existing relationships opening up to include new partners, or closing down a previously open relationship, or blended families establishing trust and intimacy. Clients may focus on involving children in change in their own or their parent\\'s lives. Upon occasions, the focus has been in the work place or school, stimulating better understanding, respect and efficiency among members of a work team.

            Making the decision to talk to a professional, a stranger for that matter, can feel quite uncomfortable. And yet, it is exactly the right decision necessary for getting your life on the track you want. I work with professionals, and couples to transform their lives from one that is limiting to one that is productive, fulfilling and limitless.

            I use approaches that research shows as effective for making changes and feeling better, e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Emotionally Focused Therapy.  I specialize in providing couple\'s therapy, pre-marital counseling and relationship enhancement workshops to all types of couples including those within the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) community.

            I am a competent, compassionate and attentive clinician with a deep passion for my work. Understanding who you are and what works for you and your relationship is the most important thing to me.  Book an appointment with me today.

            My practice is primarily based in using somatic (body aware) and relational therapy with individuals, couples and groups.  I teach people how to literally re-wire their brains to actively reduce habitual stress-based patterns and increase the joy and vitality they generate for themselves on a daily basis.  Breakthroughs in the study of the brain and its amazing plasticity have given the world powerful new tools for transformation.  I use these tools to promote clarity, hope and resiliency for a more peaceful and loving world.

            I support and celebrate poly, kink and other alternative lifestyle choices as viable options for healthy relationships.  Being a somewhat unconventional person myself, I enjoy a mobile therapy practice so am not limited to one geographic location or the standard 50 minute therapy hour.  I love the transformative power of doing therapeutic process with people, and am happy to work on-site with individuals or multi-partner groups within time frames that best serve the process. I prefer working with folks who have a clear intention of \"being the change they want to see in the world\".  I work on a sliding fee scale to accommodate anyone who demonstrates true commitment to the idea that each of us is responsible for our own peace on this planet. - Does online consultation

            I am a licensed massage therapist in New York and Pennsylvania. I currently live and work in Philadelphia, in the West Philadelphia/University City area.

            My practice is focused on 5 Element Style Shiatsu as taught in the Swedish Institute College of Health Sciences in NYC. 5 Element Shiatsu is a fusion of traditional Japanese Shiatsu, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Classical Chinese medicine and the yin/yang theory brought together to promote Mind Body and Spirit wellness.

            Along with Shiatsu massage I also use Gua Sha (a scraping technique) and Moxabustion (and herbal incense used on various acupoints) which are both described on my website.  I also infuse my Shiatsu with techniques from Tui na a style of Chinese massage related to Anma and aspects of Swedish massage when needed.

            These techniques are used to treat a wide range of issues on all three levels of the body and help promote wellness and the proper flow of Qi. They are also wonderful for relaxation!

            I am familiar and comfortable working with people of all walks of life, lifestyle and gender expression. I strive to create a safe, comfortable environment for all of my clients in order to serve them best.

        description: "I\\'m a friendly, responsible, and college-educated childcare professional. I speak English, American Sign Language, and German and I have enough experience with Cued Speech to get by. I\\'ve been working with children from newborn to teens for over ten years. I believe that love makes a family, and I enjoy working with families of all sorts. I am also open to working with special needs children. I maintain my First Aid and Adult, Infant, and Child certifications and I believe in participating in a variety of different professional development classes to keep current on best practices and get new suggestions and ideas on how best to work with children. \n\nAs a professional, I believe it\\'s important for me to stay engaged with the children I work with. I like to do a lot of hands on activities and spend active time outdoors instead of simply plopping a child in front of a tv screen or a video game. I also think it\\'s important to provide children with healthy meals and snacks and help them learn how to make good choices so that they can grow up to become healthy, happy adults. When I become a part of a child\\'s life, I feel that requires a commitment on my part to be there for that child for many years in the future, whether or not I continue to work with that child professionally. I think it is important for children to know that they are cared for and loved beyond any fees that their parents may pay me for working with them. I want them to have as much stability as possible and be able to trust that I won\\'t just disappear one day out of the blue, never to be seen again."

        description: Poly, non-monogamous, and mixed-orientation relationships are just as diverse as monogamous ones.  Folks can have any number of intimacy dynamics and creative agreements that may need to be renegotiated from time to time, and that requires knowledge of ourselves and clear communication.  While not every client will have a need to discuss their relationships or sexuality, every client deserves a therapist who is accepting and affirming of their relationship choices.  I work with diverse genders, sexualities, and relationships.  I see clients across the lifespan (kids, teens, and adults), for individual, relationship, and family therapy.  In particular, I specialize in working with the minorities within the broader LGBT minority, such as poly, bi, kinky, and genderqueer folks.  In addition to my private practice, I facilitate a drop-in group for bisexual and bi-curious men ("men" inclusive of trans* folks) at Fenway Community Health in Boston, addressing topics such as Getting Past Stereotypes, Monogamy and Polyamory, Coming Out, and Queering Sexuality.  I am a member of WPATH, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, and have received the Unsung Hero Award from the Bisexual Resource Center.

            Sexuality is one of the core components of human existence. Human sexuality embraces our identity, mind, body, gender and attractions. Our sexuality is guided and influenced by our relationships, culture, awareness, values and spirit, and can shift and evolve at any given time.

            Many of us have unaddressed sexual questions and concerns. For some, these questions are simply too uncomfortable or embarassing to explore. For others, their concerns are overshadowed by negative messages that have created shame, fear and guilt. These, compounded by the many issues we face in our daily lives - work, school, children, relationship conflicts, stress, social pressures, etc. have created barriers to having a healthy sexuality.

            Your sexuality and sexual health is a priority. Together we will work to resolve your concerns, have your questions answered, and enrich your sexual and intimacy experiences.

            Are you wanting something better, but do not know where to start? I can help you get unstuck, find answers, solve problems and feel better. Whatever is holding you back, I can help you explore it, understand it and put it behind you so you can get on with enjoying life. I will watch for your patterns and in my gentle, supportive style I will help you recognize them and change them. You will find me compassionate, open-minded, and easy to talk to.  Your first session with me is free, so you can easily determine I am a good fit for you.





            I have a special interest in relationship and sexual concerns for individuals and couples, including trauma/abuse recovery. You may be surprised at how often other things are connected to relationship and sexuality issues, e.g. self-esteem, depression, anxiety, boundaries, addictions, dissociating, insecurity, control issues, interpersonal conflicts, procrastination and more.





            A typical session with me includes a mix of conversation and exercises designed to help you reach your goals. For more about the specific techniques I use or the types of problems I can help with, have a look at my websites.

            We\'ve all gone through rough times and felt like we wanted help.  Unfortunately, the people in our lives often do not seem to know how to help us feel better.  Counseling can be a way to find the support and help you need to improve your life.  We will focus on understanding what is causing your struggles and helping you identify ways to create change and happiness.

            Searching for a counselor can be overwhelming, especially when you are already dealing with depression, anxiety, or other struggles.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions you have about working with me, or about counseling in general.

Do you feel stuck because it seems as though you are being pulled in multiple directions at the same time? Do you feel like you are sure about what you should do, but you "just cannot" get yourself to act? Do you see yourself acting out the same destructive pattern over and over again (i.e. lying awake at night worrying instead of going to sleep)? Do you feel like you are happy, but want to overcome emotional blocks to becoming the more sort of person you want to be? My partners and I do a form of counseling known as Internal Family Systems. We are all poly friendly. We also provide a number of other services, such as nutrition and exercise counseling, advice on procrastination, and much more.

        description: "My name is Damon L. Jacobs, and I help couples and individuals live with fulfillment, joy, fun, and serenity.  After 15 years of working with poly/open couples, I have found certain tools and techniques that can help people navigate some of the challenges and difficulties that can accompany these relationships.  I now offer sessions and talks in New York that promote information and empowerment for people in these arrangements. \n \nIndividuals who share love and affection with more than one person are uniquely positioned to experience deeper levels of pleasure and satisfaction in all relationships.  But without certain principles they may often flounder and become frustrated and disappointed.  These five tools will offer ideas/concrete steps that participants can immediately implement in order to gain more satisfaction and fulfillment in their relationships.  Clients learn how to: \n\n * Improve rational communication that promotes respect, integrity,\nand efficacy in interpersonal relationships with multiple partners.\n * Learn the value of staying present and ways to maintain here-and-\nnow focus.\n * Explore impact of \\\"drama\\\" in increasing frustrations and\nresentments.\n * Gain tools for managing and inevitable insecurities that arise in\npoly relationships.\n * Maintain responsibility for one\\'s own emotional wellness and state\nof serenity in relationships.\n \nI have consistently received positive feedback about the value of these tools from the participants in my talks, as well as my private pratice couples.  So please, feel free to email or call if you would like the tools and support for making YOUR relationships happier, healthier, and more fulfilling."

            I am a licensed clinical psychologist in New York State (# 012174-1) and received my doctorate in clinical psychology from Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY. My Postdoctoral training in Medical Psychology/AIDS was completed at St. Luke\'s/Roosevelt Hospital Center, NYC. I hold a Master\'s Degree in Music and my interests in psychology, music, gender and sexuality are an integral part of my work.  This includes working with GLBT people as well as those involved in polyamory and kink.  I have a wide variety of experience as a clinician, teacher, writer and speaker and offer services in several specialty areas. Memberships include the American Psychological Association, the New York State Psychological Association, the Performing Arts Medicine Association, Association for the Study of Dreams, and the American Federation of Musicians, Local 802.

            As a psychologist and psychotherapist, I believe that psychotherapy is most beneficial when it can address both broad and specific problems and help people find solutions to life\'s conflicts and stressors. Chronic stress and chronic relational conflicts often become obstacles to leading an emotionally healthy and rewarding existence. Ultimately, I believe the goal of therapy is to enable people to make decisions that will allow them to feel most satisfied, productive and in control of their lives. Likewise, learning to cope with life\'s everyday stressors, as well as crises can be an important part of psychotherapeutic work. My approach is tailored to individual needs and focuses on building a collaborative dialogue in which to work towards identified therapeutic goals. This includes symptom reduction (anxiety, depression, self-harm), as well as issues pertaining to gender, sexuality, creative blocks, performance anxiety, infertility and parenting issues, among others.

            I have worked with LGB, trans and gender nonconforming, and poly/kink individuals for more than 20 years. My approach is affirming with regard to these and other identities and lifestyles, while addressing individual, relationship and societal issues that impair functioning or negatively impact quality of life in all its spheres. In working with LGBTQI people and others with marginalized identities, I work from an approach informed by a minority stress perspective, which encompasses both vulnerability and resilience.* Clinical issues I address include those related to anxiety, depression, trauma, sexual dysfunction, substance abuse and other compulsive behaviors, relationship and intimacy difficulties.





            *I and my co-author, Rylan J. Testa, Ph.D., developed the Minority Stress Model for clinical work with transgender and gender nonconforming individuals, which we presented in our seminal article in Professional Psychology: Research and Practice in 2012.





            Your professional specialties and skills: Individual and relationship therapy and psychological assessment (including assessment for gender-confirming interventions). When doing assessment for gender-confirming interventions, I adhere to the current WPATH Standards of Care.





            Populations served: Adolescents, adults and older adults. For trans and gender nonconforming individuals, my work starts with puberty; otherwise my work starts at 14 years old.

My acupuncture is a pragmatic combination of TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine), Japanese style, Tan, ah shi, auricular, and scalp zone techniques.  OMM  (Osteopathic Musculoskeletal Manipulation, a type of medical massage) is based on retraining nerves and muscles to work properly again. Slow, gentle movements help reset the tension level of chronically tight muscles.. Scar tissue and fascial adhesions are also removed. Multiple techniques include Still, Trager, percussion, muscle energy, and myofascial release. Please see my website and blog ( RoseCityAcupuncture.com ) for more information and simple online scheduling.\n\n\n\n\n\nI serve humans of all flavors (all genders, orientations, abilities, kinks, relationship style, etc.). My office is ADA accessible.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Car accidents:** I can bill insurance companies directly.\n\n\n**Health insurance:**  Payment is requested at time of service. I can provide a coded medical receipt that you can submit for reimbursements. I will be considered an out-of-network provider. \n\n\n\n\n\nFor a first appointment I prefer an hour. 1 hr of acupuncture & massage is $90. Half hour of either one is $55.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscount packages available for multiple sessions. I do not have a sliding scale, but I do smoking cessation treatments for free ( http://rosecityacupuncture.com/blog/quitting-smoking/ ) and volunteer for the Returning Veterans program."

If you could have the relationships that you deeply desire, what would they look like? how  can you open up to a more holistic, or tantric  way  of relating?\n\n\n\n\n\nAs intimacy & relationship coach, my goal is to help you create the relationships and intimate experiences that bring you joy, and deep contentment. Part of that exploration means integrating body,  heart, and soul, so that your choices are in alignment with every aspect of your Self. Part of it means unpacking and releasing  old stories and looking for new perspectives that can guide you where you want to go. Part of it is learning communication skills - finding the words that can support you in creating the relationships that you're longing for. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhatever your goals and whatever brings you connection, joy, and love, I can offer 30 years of experience and a deep commitment to supporting your journey, by coaching you and your loved ones to  explore intimacy, tantric sensuality and sexuality, and ways to become present,  truthful, heal past trauma and create a new, honest and deeply satisfying way of relating. \n\n\n\n\n\nSome of my areas of expertise include: trauma, anxiety and shame and its psycho-somatic repair,  intimate relational presence, communication and 'slow sex' practices. I'm certified as Somatic Bodywork Practitioner and Trauma Therapist. I work with all genders, sexual orientations, and relationship styles. I'd love to welcome you to work with me via phone or video. (FaceTime, Zoom). Some of my areas of expertise include: Learning to use presence centered awareness and breath to slow down in order to create a deeply fulfilling tantric experience of closeness and/or love making, releasing trauma, fear and shame, relationship and communication issues, women's issues, sensual partner massage, simple kundalini breathing practices and other intimacy & relationship practices. \n\n\n\n\n\nI'd love to welcome you to my online office to work with you over phone or video.

            As someone with the interest and courage to follow your heart, you find there are a number of questions that arise with a need for objective, educated, unbiased and helpful answers as you proceed to explore a new path in relationships.  I have many years of experience with alternative lifestyles.  My approach is to listen to YOU - there is not a simple answer for everyone.  You need YOUR solution, not everyone else\'s. I will listen thoroughly, discuss, and then offer all possible options for you to make an informed decision.  I offer ideas that have worked for others in the poly lifestyle and allow you to pick and choose.

            What are not as apparent as ideas are the various feelings that subtly arise - fears, doubts, jealousy, anxiety, anger, depression...and all need to be recognized, processed and understood.  We aren\'t as aware of our feelings as we are of our ideas and thoughts, and feelings drive our behavior.  We act out at times and don\'t understand why, or where that behavior came from.  Understanding is the best management process - you can\'t control what you don\'t understand.

            My fees are reasonable - I will work with you so that the fee doesn\'t interfere with your receiving the assistance you need.  I respect your individual desires, needs and wants.  I am available for a brief phone interview.

I encourage people to reconnect their bodies and their spirits, their religious understandings of the incarnation (God-in-the-flesh) with positive self-esteem and sexual confidence. Because our faith journeys are informed and yet often hindered by cultural norms, we must carefully discern what is spiritually and psychologically healthy in our relationships and lifestyles as we critique the body/soul split that is taught in erotophobic churches. Jesus challenged the cultural norms of his day when they hindered healing and building relationships. We can and should do the same. - Does online consultation - Does phone consultation

            Are you experiencing anxiety or depression because of a stressful event or difficult changes in your life? Is your relationship under stress?  I can help you adjust to challenging life transitions. Life events like divorce, breakups and job loss can be hard to recover from without the appropriate support. Even welcomed life changes can create stress and overwhelm, such as, having a new baby, starting college, or entering retirement.

            Working together, we will determine the importance of social support, ways to find meaning during this life transition and how to increase your coping skills and self-esteem. If you are dealing with stress I can share with you relaxation training and techniques and show you how mindfulness can reduce stress.

            Using a collaborative approach, we will work towards discovering your hidden strengths while developing healthy goals. I will help you to move forward at a pace that works for you. Please contact me to discuss how I might be able to help you get started on the path to healing and living your best life. - Does phone consultation

        description: "I am a body-centered counselor trained in the Rubenfeld Synergy Method of body/mind work, with extensive experience working with poly, kinky, queer and gender-nonconforming individuals. I approach clients' stories and challenges with an attitude of openness, discovery, and compassion - seeking not to diagnose or identify what's \"wrong\" with you, but to help you become more aware of your own responses and habits when under stress, and locate the resources you can turn to for strength. \n\n\n\n\n\nI work using both talk and touch (as appropriate to the client's needs and preferences), and employ techniques of breathwork, meditation, and movement in addition to more traditional talk. My approach is holistic and integrative, with the goal of guiding the whole self to greater health and resilience."

            My approach to therapy emphasizes insight, emotional healing, and empowerment to help individuals and couples reach their highest potential and to have more gratifying lives. Through an alliance of trust and collaboration, we will work together to untangle confusing thoughts, feelings, and behavioral patterns to rediscover your capacity to make meaningful choices that are right for you or your relationship.

            I enjoy working collaboratively with clients by exploring unconscious conflicts and developing insight into patterns of behavior. I believe that growth occurs in an atmosphere of respect, compassion and a belief in the human capacity for healing, change and reparation. - Does online consultation - Does phone consultation

            I work with you to make therapy accessible. In my experience it\'s natural for many people to worry about finding the right therapist and how to start once they do. I will work with you build a good therapeutic relationship, to identify goals and move forward. While I have a generalist practice, I often work with adolescents and young adults who are struggling with healthy choices, anxiety and depression. I also focus my work on identity/gender issues, relationships, and sexuality/intimacy concerns including alternative lifestyles, various relationship configurations and the LGBTQI community.

            Additionally, I have extensive experience with foster care and adoption and work with all involved to help with difficult transitions. Additional experience includes self- harm, sex work and sexual violence. I use a harm reduction approach in my work with both adolescents and adults.

            I honor diversity and work in an environment that is relaxed and welcoming. I incorporate art, writing, play and creativity in my work and also enjoy walking and changing environments to allow you to feel more comfortable and think through concerns in different ways.

            I offer a supportive confidential space for you to explore yourself and create the life you desire. I utilize traditional psychotherapy as well as the power of somatics and the expressive arts. I specialize in resolving challenges with relationships and intimacy, life purpose, gender identity, sexual orientation, sexuality, social change and activism work, and healing from trauma. I work with couples to improve communication, explore sexuality, deepen intimacy, and navigate alternative relationships of all kinds. I welcome all queer, trans, genderqueer, heterosexual, polyamorous, artsy, activist, kinky, and questioning people. Please see my website for more information about my practice, expressive arts and somatics.

            Generative somatics is a path of embodied transformation that integrates the mind, body and spirit into healing work. By offering tools that align your body and actions with your desires and ideals, you can begin to create the changes you long for. Harness the power of the arts to re-awaken creativity and connect to energy and passion as well as fantasies, visions and dreams. Expressive arts have the ability to access subconscious material and find inner truth more deeply and quickly than talk therapy. Please contact me for a 20 minute phone or email consultation, free of charge.

            I am trained as a somatic practitioner, Reiki practitioner and peer counselor.  I also provide somatic education, mediation, and facilitation services. The somatic work that I practice is called Somatic Experiencing and utilizes our felt sense of the body to anchor us into our deepest wisdom, clearest intuition, and clearest paths to transformation and growth. This work was created by Dr. Peter Levine, a psychologist and biophysics. Thus, my work is grounded in the neurobiology of healing and personal transformation; the topic on which I centered my Masters research.

            I have over 15 years experience working with individuals, couples, and organizations/ groups, including over 10 years experience managing a mental health crisis drop-in center. I have also worked as a social justice activist and anti-racist/ anti-oppression educator, so I consider myself an accountable ally to communities of color and diverse communities who experience oppression in our society.

            I am queer, trans/gender variant and poly friendly and educated. I am available for phone, skype, or in-person sessions. My office is safe and accessible for people with multiple chemical sensitivities and/or environmental illness. It is also accessible for most people who use wheelchairs or have mobility disabilities. - Does online consultation - Does phone consultation

            I completed my Masters thesis as "Discrimination of BDSM Identified Individuals in a Therepeutic Setting." I am kink friendly, kink aware, and open-minded. If you are looking for a therapist who will treat YOU and not your lifestyle, you've come to the right place!

            The human mind is an amazing thing! Not so long ago, scientists and other medical experts believed that once damaged, the brain could not heal. We now know that is not true. We also have a better understanding of how the brain stores information, including past trauma, and how it is able to heal itself. The mind and body are intrinsically connected. Traumatic injury to the body and psyche are stored in the mind, and if the trauma is unprocessed, the mind replays the trauma over and over again, expecting or hoping for a new result.

            I am experienced in helping clients to process sexual issues, trauma, PTSD, and personality disorders. I am certified in EMDR, which engages the brain's hippocampus where trauma is processed. It sometimes results in shorter therapy. Overall, I utilize an eclectic approach to help you become a stronger, healthier you. - Does online consultation

            I am a psychotherapist working in private practice. I am glad to work with polyamorous individuals, couples, or constellations, whether your issues are related to polyamory or whether they are entirely unrelated and you just want to work with a therapist who will understand poly as a normal part of your life.





            I take a solution-focused approach, using aspects of psychodynamic theory, behavioral theory, or dialectical-behavioral therapy as needed by the individual client. My experience has focused on work with GLBTQIA clients and survivors of childhood trauma; I've also done a lot of work with transgender clients and people in the kink community, as well as furry/Otherkin folks.  I welcome clients of color and clients living with disabilities and long-term health problems, and I'm always eager to educate myself about the particular issues facing any of my clients. I look forward to hearing from you!

        description: Founded in 1975 as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, Seattle Institute for Sex Therapy, Education and Research operates on the principle that sexual energy is a positive expression of human life. We serve women and men of all sexual identities, orientations, and lifestyles, assisting people to explore and discover their own sexuality and to find ways to meet their needs. In general, we are supportive of all expressions of sexuality which are not self-destructive or exploitative of others. Fees are negotiable, based on ability to pay. Licensed clinicians certified in sex therapy and/or sex education deal with diverse concerns, e.g., loss of desire; obsessive sexual behavior (sometimes called sexual addiction); erection/ejaculation difficulties; orgasm; vaginismus (vaginal contractions preventing penetration); pain; trauma; paraphilias; sexual/gender identity; conflicts in relationships over sexual values, attitudes, or behaviors. Workshops are presented for both professionals and the general public, typically in co-sponsorship with a business, agency, or educational program. Free telephone consultation is available Mon. - Fri., 9 - 10 AM Pacific Time. - Does phone consultation

            Smiles By Rosie Family Dentistry the lifelong dream of Dr. Rosie Wagner, who wished to build an office that represents her treatment philosophy.  We are a poly-knowledgeable general dental office treating all ages, starting from birth.  Our approach is "No judgement, no lectures."  We focus on patients who have not been to the dentist for a long while or who just haven't felt comfortable at the dentist before due to a variety of reasons.  We are welcoming, friendly, and educate patients on why we are recommending a particular kind of treatment and let them make their own informed treatment decisions.  Besides all that, we're just the most friendly people you've ever met!

            Families of all types and dynamics welcome!  We treat all ages and perform comprehensive dentistry, including dental care in the operating room for children and adults with special needs.

        description: Four hours from Manhattan on the foothills of the Berkshires.  Offers help with sex and relationship problems of all types. Couples only. Experienced in exclusivity-to-poly and poly-to-exclusivity couples' transitions. Devoted to helping people realize their true passions in an accepting environment. Private Intensive Couples Retreats are offered for those who live a distance from Cummington, and don't want to commute for weekly sessions. Many couples find that they are able to make more progress with intensives, because they have the time and emotional space to focus on the complexity and uniqueness of their relationship, away from the daily pressures of modern life. They not only resolve problematic dynamics but also learn new ways of relating to each other. exploring their deeper values and life goals. Work occurs in a rural, tranquil setting and includes one weekend including a Friday evening 2 hour meeting and 2 days 9:30-4:30 pm. While the majority of time in these sessions will be spent meeting with you as a couple, I also schedule to meet with each of you individually for some of that time. The goal of this "intimate relationship get-a-ways" is to assess and improve the dynamics that has brought you into therapy. Clients including sex therapy will explore their sexual styles and how these styles interact to enhance or detract from a satisfying sexual relationship. In addition, we'll cover skills that will help you achieve specific goals to resolve your relationship issues. As a result of this weekend, you may feel a sense of relief about the opportunity to move through stuck interaction and into a better way of getting along. Follow-up sessions are four hours long with a 30 minute break after two hours. Allow 4.5 hours total. - Does online consultation.

I have been providing Psychotherapy treatment to individuals, couples and families for over 10 years.  In addition to being a clinician, I am an educator, researcher and advocate.\n  \nFinding the right psychotherapist can be challenging, especially if your lifestyle choices fall outside of what is considered \"normal\" by mainstream society.     \n \nEveryone--including individuals who are part of alternative relationships--deserves a psychotherapist who understands where they are coming from. I have been working with sexual and gender minorities, and those who fall outside of the mainstream, for 12 years.

        description: |-
            The foundation of my therapy is to create a safe, non-judgemental space for the client to discover their inherent wisdom and healing potential. The relationships I build with clients are based on empathy and respect for the client's unique process. The human self is not a static entity. We are always unfolding and becoming, in each moment.

            Sometimes, trauma cuts us off from this process of unfolding. Many of us have learned maladaptive coping strategies in response to traumatic environments. Later in life, this may lead us to become "stuck" in self-destructive habits or unhealthy relationships. We may hold trauma in the body, which keeps us constricted and disconnected from the world around us.

            I focus on empowering clients to break out of those patterns and live fuller lives.

            I help clients develop skills to manage overwhelming emotions, through mindfulness, self-care and nurturing connections with others. My goal is not just to provide tools for clients to manage problems, but rather, to help them develop an internal sense of strength and resiliency.

            My primary focus, in therapy, is on the here-and-now. I use techniques of mindfulness and body awareness to deepen understanding of emotions, and how they affect human connection in the present moment. I also teach meditation practices for relaxation and anxiety management. These may include breathing and visualization exercises. I work with clients to discover meditation practices that suit their unique needs.

            I have a background in both Transpersonal and Existential psychotherapy. I support the client's freedom to find their own source of meaning in their lives. I honor each client's unique spiritual path, and create safe space for diverse religious traditions. I collaborate with clients to create their own rituals to honor life transitions, empower themselves, process grief and move beyond trauma. I have a real passion for exploring dreams with clients, drawing influence from both Gestalt and Jungian dream work.

            I specialize in working with the LGBT and Poly community.  I work with individuals of all genders and sexual orientations.

        description: "The work I do is based on the notion that we are being called upon to imagine, implement, and integrate a sustainable way of existing on this earth. In order to do that, I believe we need access to as many different ways of understanding our own experiences as possible. I use the modalities of astrology, past life regression therapy, tarot and other forms of soul work to assist you in navigating your own path so that you can claim your own power and unique skills in order to find or better navigate your own path. I like to find ways to engage the mystery rather than explaining it away, and also try to make my \"woo\" as practical as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the time, my clients are people who are searching for more embodied and meaningful ways of dealing with their own \"stuff.\" I serve adults and have experience working with LGBTQ folks and am kink and poly (non-monogamy) friendly as well. I am particularly interested in working with individuals who are exploring their sexuality and relationship preferences with an awareness that conventional models aren't applicable or even helpful for all of us. \n\n\n\n\n\nSpecific session information as well as fees can be found on my website, but I basically offer astrological consultations, ongoing coaching and past life regression work. Additionally, I offer classes and workshops throughout the year at various locations in Seattle. My goal is to keep this work accessible --  sliding scale options are available."

            Are you tired of looking for a therapist who "gets it"? It can be infuriating to have to take the time to explain who you are to someone who may pathologize you, treat you like a novelty, or avoid talking about the relationships, behaviors, and events that are important to you.

            You don't have to separate your personal and social justice values from your desire for compassionate support. You can finally have what you have been looking for.

            As a feminist therapist,  I support your progressive values and celebrate the unique ways you express your gender or choose to live and love in your body. I can see your strengths as well as your challenges. This can make it easier to build trust, so you can focus on your goals and personal growth.

        description: Welcome. You have taken the first steps toward finding a therapist, a very personal and significant decision. I am a licensed Psychotherapist and Board Certified Clinical Sexologist practicing in Midtown, Manhattan as well as on Long Island. I am caring, skilled, and experienced in working with individuals, providing couples therapy and family therapy for those who are in both traditional and non-traditional relationships. Most of us have struggled with dating, relationships and communication at some point. Few of us are formally taught how to create rewarding relationships in which we may lovingly and effectively communicate our preferences and have our desires met. Whether you are gay or straight and are dating, engaged or married, you and your partner may be facing various problems for which there are solutions. My work with individuals, couples and families aims to alleviate distressing symptoms, enhance relationships and encourage self-awareness and growth. If your relationship is suffering, it may be one of the many that can be saved with the proper guidance. If your conflicts cannot be reconciled, therapy can assist you in leaving the relationship on good terms, allowing you both to proceed with healthier and more confident outlooks. - Does Facetime and telephone consultations.

Garner, LCSW-C has been a staple of the mental health community providing services to poly and kink individuals and couples for almost a decade.  Heather has recently expanded her services to include sex therapy, following her completion of the University of Michigan Sexual Health Certificate Program, Sex Therapy Track.  Heather believes passionately in providing services to the kink and poly communities and has build Garnering Change Psychotherapy to focus on intimate relationships, sexual health, and the transition to parenthood with other like-minded therapists.  If you are looking for an experienced, compassionate, and knowledgable therapist who is well respected in the kink and poly communities, look no further than Heather M. Garner, LCSW-C at Garnering Change Psychotherapy. \n\n\n\n\n\nHeather M. Garner is a Licensed Certified Social Worker Clinical (LCSW-C) with a private psychotherapy practice in Towson, Maryland where she provides individual and couples therapy and sex therapy.  Heather is a kink and consensual non-monogamy/ \"poly\"-knowledgeable sex therapist with extensive experience treating couples and individuals in the kink community. She has found that while most people worry about the first step of contacting a therapist, members of the kink and poly communities often have a more difficult time entering into treatment. Members of these communities need to find a therapist who will not make his or her lifestyle choices an issue when it is not one. They also should not be responsible for educating their therapist about his or her interests, sexual activities, or desires. In working with Heather, you will find a kink and consensually non-monogamous/ \"poly\"-knowledgeable, non-judgmental, compassionate sex therapist who has worked with a wide variety of clients with varying interests, roles, gender identities, sexual orientations, and relationship structures. As a member of AASECT, Heather values her clients' individuality and sexuality and works with clients to encourage consensual, exploitation-free, honest, protected, and pleasurable encounters.  In addition to her direct work with clients, Heather also believes strongly in education for the mental health, poly and kink communities.  She teaches consensually non-monogamous and kink-based continuing education courses for mental health professionals and regularly presents at kink community and group events.   Along with her work with consensually non-monogamous/ polyamorous persons, Heather has training in Trauma-Focused Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), Grief Recovery, is a Certified Relational Life Therapy clinician (RLT), and she holds a certificate from the University of Michigan Sexual Health Certificate Program, Sex Therapy Track."

            People tend to come to therapy when they find themselves at an impasse. Maybe you are facing a major decision, or an old way of coping has stopped working. Maybe you feel blocked from pursuing something you want. Most of my patients have significant strengths, and are functioning well in many areas of life, but come to therapy because they feel blocked in some important way, or sense that they could be more at ease, more flexible, more able to enjoy the positive things in their lives.







            Of course, even very high-functioning people can experience very serious psychiatric symptoms. I have worked well with individuals struggling with anxiety (including panic, worry, and trauma) and mood disorders such as depression.







            I particularly enjoy working with people in the LGBTQ community and have worked well with trans or nonbinary people in various stages of transition. I welcome patients with 'alternative' sexualities, including polyamory and kink and strive to provide an open, non-judgmental space for all my patients.







            I work with adults 18+ only, individuals and couples/polycules.







            Please don't hesitate to contact me with questions!

            HOPE AND HELP FOR YOUR RELATIONSHIP

            Your relationship is deeply important. When emotional and physical intimacy break down, it's easy to get stuck in despair or resentment. The choices seem awful: stay in this depressing situation or leave.

            But there's a third way: get help to move past the hurt and rediscover the joy you once felt. You can stop the fighting, enjoy satisfying sex, rebuild trust, and end abuse. With stronger communication and renewed commitment, your relationship will thrive.

            From my own life and my work as a counselor, I know how hard it is to stay connected over the long term. I also know it's worth it. My research-based approach dramatically reduces the risk of separation and divorce. Your relationship is worth fighting for.

            I can help you:

            -- Bring back warmth and connection
            -- Overcome frustrating sexual issues
            -- Make sense of your unconventional relationship
            -- Put an end to hurtful and abusive behavior

            The first step toward getting help is often the hardest. Having the right person on your side as you rebuild your relationship makes a big difference. Call me for a free consultation. I look forward to working with you.

            Real change comes from understanding why our own impulses and behaviors hold us back from experiencing our true potential and discovering the skills to create the change we seek.  I believe in a holistic, person-centered approach to therapy that helps people find the answers that were inside them all along.  As a therapist, I am intuitive and compassionate, yet direct, and employ a mix of modalities, including traditional psychotherapy, cognitive therapy and mindfulness techniques.

            I have a special interest in working with adolescents and adults who are dealing with chronic illnesses, new disabilities, end-of-life issues, caregiver stress, grief/loss and individuals from the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and non-conforming gender communities.  I also have interest in working with people who are questioning their sexual and relationship practices.

I am especially drawn to support people who may fall through the cracks of the medical system or otherwise feel unheard through the process of medical birth -- younger and older parents, single parents, LGBT, genderqueer and GNC parents, people making adoption plans, and people experiencing stillbirth or fetal loss. I also specialize in supporting alternative parents who want to feel comfortable with a professional with whom they can share their family dynamics openly, such as polyamorous families and people in power-dynamic relationships. I can serve clients with household incomes under $30K at no cost under the auspices of the Doula Project (www.doulaproject.org). Postpartum and lactation services also available.

            Many people have found that they thrive in a relationship structure that stretches beyond monogamy. Having a relationship structure that falls outside the boundaries of what was is deemed as "normal" can bring a variety of unique challenges.

            Whether you are in the beginning stages of exploration with a primary partner or you are in an established poly relationship, we can work together to confront the vulnerabilities, the dynamics of power and control, and the communication breakdowns that are a part of all relationships. Our therapeutic work can assist in addressing these concerns within the primary couple or your extended relationship structure.

My personal experiences have led to my choice to become a relationship coach, with an expertise in alternative types of relationships. This is also described at my website where you can find more information about how to deal with polyamory and/or living with a polyamorous partner. \n\nThe most important thing for me is that clients find their own way in how they want to live their lives, with of without more than one love. My goal is helping people to find their own solutions for their situation, not my solution. I challenge people to live from authenticity, as it creates passion and energy.\n\nI am currently writing a book about my experiences with coaching clients with polyamory challenges, and describe how they found their solutions. I do this together with the Swedish writer Stephan Wik. The book will be published both in English as Dutch in Spring 2010. I have given various interviews in Dutch magazines about polyamory and open relationships. I give workshops for counselors and other social workers, how to adapt their way of helping clients with different types of love relationships."

        description: Hi there, my name is Darren Ramsey. After ending a long-term married relationship, I took what I had learned from the marriage and began exploring what I really wanted in a relationship. What I found was that the answer to, What kind of person would I like to be with? was complex, and in some ways did not seem realistic. I did not want someone identical to myself - I enjoy the differences between myself and others - and upon realising that I was not completely fulfilled in a traditional style relationship, I began to define myself in new ways. That lead to the discovery of the word that summed my ideas up - Polyamory. Ever since that day, I allowed myself to be open to finding more than one partner each having different qualities that worked for my own personality and life - and that I now have fulfilling, well-rounded relationships in parallels with. Immersing myself in polyamory communities, like PolySA in South Australia and others, I soon found that there is actually an increasing number of people are expressing interest in alternative styles of relationships and not only that, they had questions about it - and that contributed to Relationships Evolved being born. My story does not end with Polyamory though. I also immerse myself in other non-traditional communities, personally identifying with many of them including LGBTIQ and the BDSM scene. As an internationally-accredited Master Performance Coach, NLP Practitioner, Master Hypnotherapist and Lifestyle coach, I decided to specialise in the field of Relationship Coaching and Education several years ago. After personally experiencing some relationship challenges and having the desire to find and work with an understanding and non-judgmental Relationship Professional, I was disappointed with what I found in the community. I became passionate about filling the gap and it became a driver to immersing myself in intense study and practice. Having worked with individuals, couples and groups helping them resolve their issues, build strong self confidence and achieve solid relationship foundations; I now uses those skills to help even more people. Using my unique and friendly presenting style, I also deliver workshops to groups that are specifically designed to educate people in all relationship choices and levels of evolution. Whether people are looking to heal past hurts, find new connections, build on their existing relationships or exit a relationship whilst maintaining respect and self esteem, we at Relationships Evolved have the tools and techniques to help. In fact, my personal vision is to teach people how to do it all themselves, effectively placing the tools and techniques to create, maintain and enrich relationships in to the hands of everyone who wants them. -Through the power of knowledge, the wisdom of thought and the belief in the kindness of human nature, may we all prosper- [Darren Ramsey, 2009] - Does online consultation - Does phone consultation

Over the years I have acquired a large toolkit of skills and techniques, and I offer an approach uniquely tailored to what works best for you and the particular challenges you are experiencing. My style is warm and interactive, gentle and direct. I think of my role as that of a co-explorer. Together we uncover themes woven throughout your life, helping you understand any patterns or beliefs that have been holding you back. With this greater awareness you will have more choice and freedom to bring your authentic self to the people in your life and to live the life you most desire. I feel honoured to engage in intimate explorations with clients to create the life changes they desire. I bring my open heart and playful curiosity to my work. I enjoy supporting my clients in navigating the nitty gritty details of their lives with more love and grace while simultaneously holding their bigger picture goals. Couples counselling: Dynamics inevitably develop when in relationships. My facilitation identifies personal and relational patterns, loops, or triggers that you and your partner may find yourself stuck in. As we explore your relationship dynamics, I help you get to the heart of your feelings, teach you to communicate those feelings with clarity, and to truly hear one another. I provide a non-judgmental and supportive space within which couples can safely express vulnerable feelings, fears, and desires. I consider myself an ally for your relationship. I am committed to teaching couples how to bring more love and playfulness to their communication even, or perhaps especially, when things are difficult.'

            I am a Denver-based private practice psychotherapist who enjoys the complexities of the human experience. My approach combines non-judgmental loving kindness with present-moment awareness and understanding of systems of oppression. I am passionate about working with people who have traditionally been marginalized by society, and exploring or creating pathways towards liberation.  I also specialize in trauma and developmental/attachment wounding.





            I work primarily with individuals and occasionally run groups. To accommodate economic hardship, I offer a temporary fee reduction.  Please call to set up a free 20-minute phone consultation to see if my services are a good fit.

        description: "Here at Turning Point Family Therapy, I offer compassionate counseling for all of life's events in the Denver metro area. My clients include individuals, couples, families (of every kind), children and adolescents.\n\nChoosing a mental health provider is one of the most important decisions you can make. You want someone who is caring, knowledgeable, accessible and willing to take time for you and treat you as a person, not just a client. \n\nMy mission as a therapist is to provide a compassionate, non-judgmental space where you feel free to express yourself. I respect the mind, body, and spirit to promote clients' vitality, passion and purpose. I honor the uniqueness of each individual while allowing the family to bloom.\n\nI believe therapy should be a collaborative process between the client and me. I value working with clients' strengths as a way to help clients reach goals and make positive changes. I believe therapy is not meant to fix parts of us that are broken but to allow us to become the best version of ourselves."

We treat individuals, couples, and families with a variety of problems including depression, addictions, anger management, sexual dysfunctions, and many others. All clients are seen in our private offices, where strict confidentiality is maintained. The majority of our referrals are word of mouth, although our clients may be referred by their physicians, financial planners, attorneys, companies, or by other professionals. We are convenient to most of the Louisville Metropolitan Area located at 105 Daventry Lane, Suite 205, Louisville, KY 40223. Contact us at (502) 594-2829 with questions or to schedule an appointment. Marriage/Relationship Counseling: Oak & Associates, LLC,  specializes in the profound issues of modern relationships such as; relationship problems, building and ending relationships, two-career couples, premarital counseling, poly-relationships, same-sex relationships, couples counseling, marriage counseling, and love/romance addiction. Sex Therapy/Sexuality Counseling: At Oak & Associates, LLC, licensed clinicians serve couples and individuals with diverse sexuality concerns. We are skilled in dealing with a variety of issues, including loss of desire; obsessive sexual behavior; erection or ejaculation difficulties; sexual identity; orgasm; vaginismus; pain; trauma; paraphilias; dating and courtship skills; and conflicts in relationships over sexual values, attitudes, or behaviors. We work with adult women and men of different sexual orientations, cultures, and lifestyles.

Homework is assigned and is necessary to achieve and maintain significant change. Holistic Relationship, Intimacy & Sex Coaching: Relationships: Life is all about relationships. Everything that we do as Human Beings revolves around our relationships with one another. We desire our relationships to be harmonious, balanced and fulfilling. Our focus is to enhance your skills and knowledge in order for intimacy to blossom in your life NOW. Our relationships with each other, especially personal or intimate relationships, require an ability to be open, honest and vulnerable. We haven''t always had a safe place to learn how to be that honest and vulnerable. The good news is that healthy relationship skills can be learned, and unhealthy relationship patterns can be changed. We assist you to develop and fine-tune their skills in order to create balanced and fulfilling relationships is the role of a Relationship Coach. Intimacy: Intimacy Coaching helps individuals and couples to achieve effective communication, relationship fulfillment, and increased sexual confidence and pleasure. Our focus is to enhance your skills and knowledge in order for intimacy to blossom in your life NOW. We assist you in overcoming your concerns in a relaxed and personalized format through which you will be taught life-changing information about your body, sexual system, desires, habits and techniques. Sex: Sex Coaching is a more recent and somewhat broader approach to addressing concerns about sexual functioning and satisfaction, where specific sexual disorders and dysfunctions are not present. Typically, clients play a larger role in defining their goals and take more responsibility for accomplishing them. The goals are more likely related to self-awareness, enhanced erotic responsiveness, and emotional intimacy. Our focus is to provide information, suggestions, and support for beginning new ways of thinking, behaving, and responding. This often includes a much broader array of home assignments. - Does online consultation'

            I offer decision coaching to individuals, couples and groups who want to solve problems together. I use tools to help you think more creatively and systematically about your big choices, and to help you tackle the small choices along the way and overcome your obstacles.





            My approach is very pragmatic, and you will benefit most from working with me if you want to focus on your current situation and your upcoming decisions, rather than on the past. Steps along the way include clarifying core goals and values; evaluating options; dealing with trade-offs, risks and uncertainties; developing smarter solutions; and implementing plans to achieve goals. For couples and groups, the process also includes clarification of common and differing interests. Whenever possible, we will shoot for creative problem solving rather than negotiation and compromises. This works best if all parties are willing to consider new ideas and think harder and further. It is surprising how often the best solutions are not the ones that first come to mind.





            We may also work via phone, Skype, FaceTime, or other online channels, including shared online documents and tools.





            My Background: PhD in Psychology from the University of Freiburg, Switzerland. Currently teaching decision-making and counseling classes at Portland State University and Marylhurst University. Co-author of the book: "Heart and Mind: Mastering the Art of Decision Making," and of numerous peer-reviewed research articles in psychology, neuroscience, decision-making, and coaching techniques.

        description: "My number one goal as a psychotherapist and coach is to provide a space for you to talk, heal, grow, try new ways of being, and become empowered to take your next steps towards the life you want.  In business, we seldom think twice about hiring experts and consultants, consulting with a board of directors, or searching for the right mentor to help us create success.  History proves that teams succeed where individuals cannot. Why offer less than the same to yourself?  If you are tired of walking the path alone, I am here to walk it with you. \n\nI enjoy working with people who think and live on the edges of the normal bell curve.  I tend to focus on adults, 30 and up, as individuals and in various relationship configurations.  People come to me for a variety of reasons:  relationship issues, adjustment to life changes (job loss, divorce, death, breakups), emotional/mental tuneups, rediscovering who they are and why they are here, taking back their lives from anxiety, depression, trauma, and so on. Whatever the reason, I use counseling and coaching techniques to help each person develop and activate a plan to move forward and create more satisfying results in life.  \n\nPeople of all persuasions are welcome at my door:  straight, LGBTQ, married, partnered, poly, pagan, Christian, \"spiritual\" . . . whatever your identification, I look forward to hearing your story and helping you write the next chapter.\n\nIf you want more information (or the more formal version of who I am, what I do, and my credentials), please click to my website or search for me in The Therapy Directory at the Psychology Today web site."

        description: The name Black Sheep Counseling Services was chosen to portray an openness to standing separate or outside of a group. It was created because I noticed a clear need for therapy services that embrace differences and uniqueness. Often a therapist's own cultural perspective can create judgment and distance that isn't readily apparent and that blocks progress in therapy. At Black Sheep Counseling Services I believe that therapy exists to help people develop personal insight and to create the life they desire; not as a way to conform others to societal expectations.

        description: I am a certified Life Coach, Hypnotherapist, Time Paradigm Techniques(tm) Practitioner and Stress Biofeedback Practitioner who is also trained in family and couples therapy. My private practice is located in Melville, Johannesburg. I coach clients one on one or in small groups, and I also work with couples, families, several NGOs, schools and organisations. Face to face sessions are preferred, however webcam sessions can also be held via Skype or MSN Messenger, in certain circumstances. I am a woman who is comfortable working with either adults or teens. What matters most is YOU the client, knowing you are in a comfortable and safe space - ready to make the changes which will set you on the path towards YOUR authentic life. I spent ten years working as a manager in the corporate world, before a life-changing journey to the summit of Kilimanjaro inspired me to change the direction of my life and pursue passion, personal reward and adventure. It has not always been easy, I fall down, I get up again, I process the feedback, and I move forward. Coaching has supplied me with the tools to equip others to strive towards their own personal goals, whether it is finding the part of you which you lost long ago, or if you find yourself ready to set aside emotional baggage it no longer serves you to carry. I do not limit or seek to "fix" my clients. This does not mean the "fix" will not come. It will. All my clients are already perfect souls with unlimited potential. I am results focused. I have no interest in signing you up for life. I want to work with you, starting at point A, and ending at point B. You WILL succeed. Your goal might be anxiety relief, the formation of a career goal, weight and self esteem management or the elimination of a phobia. Or anything else. It really does not matter what you bring to our table. You will succeed. I will simply be your guide. I am comfortable in both private and business coaching environments. I have experience presenting to large groups, and am available for motivational presentations. To book a session (your first session is always free), request a rate card, or to chat to me directly please make contact via email. The first one hour session is always free, giving us a chance to meet each other without pressure and assess the potential of a future client-coach relationship. I hope to meet you soon!

        description: "Compassionate counseling services provided in person or on the phone at affordable rates to fit your budget. Solution focused, I help you turn your life/relationship challenges into opportunities for connection and growth. \n\nRelationships bring both deep joy and pain because we are all doing our best to get our own needs met.  What started out as something exciting, erotic and caring can easily turn into unresolved conflicts, pain and blaming each other.  Often in the chaos of intense feelings and interpsersonal conflict, we lose sight of any tools or skills we can use to create a life we all want.  My goals are to help you to become more aware of who you, what you want, how to communite when those wants/needs collide with the wants/needs of the ones you love, and most importantly to create a process that builds bridges, trust and connection in order to deal with the inevitable ups and downs that are inherent in \"more loving.\"    \n\nI've have been personally involved in both BDSM and poly relationships for over a decade. It has been an honor to bring the passion I have to support individuals, couples and families for 30 years to the sex-positive community.

        description: Do you want to feel better without conforming to someone elses idea of wellness to do so? Are you hitting hard spots in a relationship but are wary about seeking counseling for fear that important aspects of that relationship will not be understood? I specialize in working with adults and children who have found themselves out-of-the-box in one way or another, whether that be high sensitivity or learning, neurological, or physical differences, gender expression or sexual orientation and expression, or simply an unconventional experience and expression of life. Oftentimes these differences became tied up with hurt and sadness and with coping strategies as individuals navigated a world that often misunderstood them. I use and teach a body-oriented, mindful, heart-centered approach to resolve these hurts and develop new strategies. I welcome the unique and authentic in each person and relationship and honor the ways that each person, by being themselves, opens up more room in the world.

I''ve worked  with many poly couples, thruples and moresomes and am comfortable doing so. Some of what we''ve worked with are: communication issues, dealing with conflict, negotiating boundaries, dealing with boundary violations, opening the relationship, closing the relationship, redefining the relationship, adding kink into the relationship, dealing with sexual issues and dealing with the general life issues that impact every type of relationship. While based in Los Angeles, I am also experienced in teleconferencing and Internet/Skype, especially for those "long-distance" relationship aspects.'

        description: 'I believe that a wellness model truly supports the whole person: the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual self in each of us. This informs my work with individuals, couples, and groups by making psychotherapy an exciting journey in which, together, we find how their unique abilities and strengths can be applied to challenging life situations, relationships, and the unfolding of new ways of being. My experience allows me to serve clients in crisis and those suffering from traumas, address a variety of symptoms such as anxiety and depression, work with unique populations such as sexually and gender-diverse people, and facilitate deep personal growth and identity development in others. I work cognitively, symbolically, and somatically, and maintain a practice rooted in interpersonal feminism and mindful compassion. Two decades of studying eco-psychology and world religions gives me an appreciation of diversity and the sacred while allowing me to join my clients as a companion on their unique personal journeys. My approach to relationships is based in emotionally focused couples therapy (EFT) and I am dedicated to serving the polyamorous and multiply partnered communities in San Francisco.'

I believe that paying attention to each clients unique lived experience is central to therapeutic growth and connection. I offer counseling and therapy to women, men, and gender-queer people who want to feel relief and wish to explore the possibilities for their healing.

            In my practice I work with gay men, lesbians, transgender folk, queer individuals, as well as those who fit into other sexual minorities. I am queer-affirmative and understanding of varying sexual desires and behaviors. I see clients who struggle with creating a healthy sexual identity, managing feelings of isolation and marginalization, or integrating sexuality into a fulfilling life. In addition, I understand the relationship of queer identity and mental health, substance use, compulsive sexual behaviors, and HIV/AIDS.

            Another specialty is work with young adults, life transitions, and emerging adulthood. As both contemporary and professional I can offer insight into the difficulties and experiences of growing up queer in the age of Y2K, the Internet, and radically shifting gay politics, as well as navigating adulthood during unstable economies.

            I understand the importance of race, ethnicity, and class--social justice and work with disenfranchised populations are key parts of my practice and philosophy. I value open communication and the power of relationships, as well as the inherent worth of all people and the right to a rich, purposeful life.

            In a dream I was asked, What is it you do? I replied, I am a life saver for human souls. At the time I was working in community mental health and teaching yoga. Since then I have trained as a professional massage therapist. I still have no better answer. I believe that health of mind, body and soul are integral to us all. We each need touch, freedom to move our bodies, and companions who hear us and recognize our potential as human beings, in order to navigate this ocean of life. I offer individual, couple and group psychotherapy (talk therapy) with a focus on working with people who are part of the open-relationship, polyamory and alternative sexuality communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. Additionally I have a practice providing therapeutic massage and individual and small-group yoga instruction. Presenting this information together here speaks to my holistic approach, however if you see me for talk therapy this means that you cannot also see me for massage or yoga instruction, because the ethical standards of Clinical Psychology prohibit having multiple relations with a client.

            I work with individuals or couples of any gender or sexual orientation who seek help for sexual relationship issues. These issues are not limited to, but include arousal and orgasm issues, sexual desire issues, compulsive sexual behavior, masturbation issues, premature or delayed ejaculation, pain during sexual activity and psychological issues around monogamy, infidelity, boredom and wanting a change in one's sexual repertoire. The goal is often increased eroticism, heightened intimacy, and decreased anxiety during sex. My aim is for you to overcome the problems that result from negative feelings and behaviors and to achieve your full sexual potential.





            I specialize in sex therapy and psychotherapy with an emphasis on human sexuality, evolutionary psychology, sexual and gender identities, and dealing with socially constructed gender roles. I also work with transgender issues and sex work/sex industry issues, both on behalf of clients and sex workers.





            My clients are often men who have been branded by others as "sex addicts;" I also have clients who buy and sell sexual services, as well as couples who want to work with someone non-judgmental when it comes to alternative, non-monogamous lifestyles and polyamory. Finally, I have been dedicated to helping transgender individuals during both pre and post transition for over 20 years.

No matter where you are coming from, or what your lifestyle is, I create a warm, accepting space for you to work on your problems. Sometimes those problems are obvious, such as anxiety, depression, relationship issues, or trauma. Sometimes they are more subtle, such a feeling that \"something is wrong\" or that \"I wish I could be happier but don't know how.\" I use a variety of supportive, compassionate therapy techniques to help you get the healing you want.\n\nI work with Polyamorous relationships in all configurations, as well as sexual minorities of all kinds including trans, queer, kink and intersex.\n\nCall (510) 771-7760 for a free, confidential consultation. \n\nAnd, if you are suffering from trauma or have gone through any kind of troubling experience, such as abuse or PTSD, I offer powerful, proven techniques such as EMDR (Google it!) and hypnotherapy that can eliminate disturbing and intrusive thoughts, flashbacks and repetitive memories. These techniques can help you with sleep, anxiety and depression. After engaging in counseling with me, many clients feel they get their lives back! - Does phone consultation"

        description: |-
            I am a psychotherapist in the South Bay with a specialty focus on alternative lifestyles--including polyamory, swinging, and kink/BDSM involvement. I have helped many individuals and couples navigate these lifestyle choices, and I realize how important it is to talk to someone who is open to non-monogamous lifestyles and who is open-minded in general. I know how important it is not to feel judged for the lifestyle you are leading even if it goes against prevailing social norms. By contrast, I aim to listen closely to what YOU are bringing in: what is strong in your life and where you may be struggling or having emotional pain.





            It is difficult to start a course of therapy. But if you are in emotional pain, it can feel like moods and issues are running your life rather than you doing so. This can leave you feeling lost, confused, and distressed. When you are under this dark cloud, it can be very helpful to talk to an objective outsider in a safe, confidential, and professional yet intimate setting. My goal is to work together to recognize hindrances and unhelpful patterns and to accentuate personal strengths in order to regain a sense of agency and equanimity in your life.





            I have more than 15 years experience in the mental health field. I have been trained in Positive Psychology, Group therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and Mindfulness coping skills. These methods can help alleviate symptoms of depression or anxiety and address debilitating aspects of trauma. For more information, see www.ednawallace.com.





            Per my website, I charge $220 for a couples session (1 hour) and $180 for an individual session (50 minutes). I am not on any insurance panels, but you can submit my super bill to your insurance if they offer out-of-network provider benefits. In addition, I have some sliding scale spots.





            I look forward to working with you!

        description: I am a licensed psychotherapist with about 10 years of personal and professional experience with non-monogamy, and I specialize in working with couples. I work mostly with primary couples who want to strengthen their bond as one partner or both begin to include others in some deeper emotional and/or sexual way. I've helped many couples successfully move through the early stages of opening their relationship, and I've helped those who've been open for some time and need to repair a recent misstep or reevaluate their relationship. My approach emphasizes communication that is heard, felt and understood. I can also offer lots of tools, ideas and insights for couples who are new to open relationships. With an attitude of humor, curiosity and compassion, I want to help you find the structure that works for you. I have been in both monogamous and open relationships and am not biased toward one or the other. I believe it is important for each couple to find the relationship structure that best suits their needs and goals. I am committed to assisting those with any gender identity in finding love and connection. I have experience working with couples who desire to feel close again, need to regain trust after the crisis of an affair or loss, or need help with a specific issue such as sex, money or open relationship. We will locate where communication breaks down, explore the underlying feelings, and emphasize the resources and positive feelings that are sometimes withheld. I only accept out-of-network insurance coverage. I am available for Skype sessions for California residents.

            I am a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist in California, offering services at my office in Oakland as well as online to California residents.  I provide psychotherapy and coaching for a variety of issues, including trauma, depression, anxiety, living with HIV/AIDS, grief and loss, interpersonal and relationship problems (specifically polyamorous and nonmonogamous folks), questions of sexual identity, confusion around vocation and life purpose, and more. Although I have a diverse practice, my specialties include:





            - EMDR for rapid, effective healing from the enduring impacts of trauma


            - Working with people questioning their gender identity, exploring/pursuing transitioning, or seeking mental health assessment letters for surgery


            - Working with gay men to develop an identity, lifestyle, and relationship that are true to their deepest selves


            - Working with women from a feminist perspective to examine and challenge oppressive social conditioning and double standards at work and in relationships





            My clients find a comfortable, supportive and engaging atmosphere. The process of therapy leads to healing from loss, developing deeper intimacy with others, becoming more resilient, and letting go of emotional patterns that no longer serve you. Effective therapy involves a moment-to-moment experience of both feelings and ideas in order to understand the past, to live more fully in the present and to choose well for the future. My own healing journey and life experience as an artist, photographer, gay man, nature lover, traveler, student, therapy client, Buddhist practitioner and worker for social justice enable me to bring a breadth of understanding and wisdom to the lives of the people with whom I work.





            I am not paneled with any insurance companies other than a few Employee Assistance Programs (see my website for details on this.)  I require full payment at the time of each session; however, I can provide a statement that you may use to seek reimbursement from your insurance company if they cover out-of-network therapy services. Please visit my web site to see my current fees.

        description: "Do you need help with relational issues and have you found therapists who lack understanding or who have judgements about your lifestyle? I specialize in gender, sexuality, and relationship diversity. I work with LGBT+ individuals, couples, and other relationship groupings, artists, Burning Man attendees, and others who have felt judged or misunderstood by therapists. I am BDSM and open relationship knowledgeable. I also enjoy working with therapists-in-training who are doing their own work to become better therapists and with new parents struggling to figure how their lives have changed. I have completed Level 1 Gottman Method training as well as Level 1 Internal Family Systems training. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI offer expertise in communication, polyamory, and open relationships. I am interested in exploring new archetypes for masculinity and femininity. I support people creating rites of passage in their own lives: emerging from the family as a differentiated individual, the transition into parenthood, the beginning or ending of relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving attended Pacifica Graduate Institute, I approach the work from a Jungian background. I enjoy working with archetypes, dream material, play therapy for adults, and exploring past experiences for present benefit. I also use Family Systems Therapy and Solution Focused Therapy to help clients find more harmony in their lives. Call for a free 20 minute phone consultation and start your journey."

        description: "Therapy is a process. It is a living and breathing evolution in understanding. And self-discovery is both the journey and the destination. \n\nCuriosity about yourself, and the desire to understand the way your world works, is the jumping-off point. What is your primary way of knowing what you know? What are your defenses and where do they come from? What is your range of emotions and how do they serve you? What drives you, and what holds you back? \n\nHeightening our own awareness of our intentions, our triggers, assumptions we make, and patterns we repeat, gives us a keener sense of our strengths, limitations, and purpose. Change is a constant in the universe-at-large and in our personal sets of circumstances. In asking (and answering) these questions of ourselves, we develop our own unique set of tools to adapt, cope, heal and thrive. (What we are conscious of, we control. What we are unconscious of controls us.  - Anonymous) \n\nMy areas of special focus include sex workers, alternative sexuality and gender, polyamorous lifestyles, body image, and personal and family relationships. The space we will create together will be one of non-judgment and unconditional understanding. And you will set the direction, pace and boundaries of our conversation. \n\nSo, whenever you are ready, come on in. Have a seat. I am looking forward to knowing you.\n \n\nMarriage and Family Therapist Registered Intern, IMF 70302.\n\nSupervised by Gail Sher, MFT, MFC 27514 - Does online consultation - Does phone consultation"

            I work with families, children (4 & up), teens, and adults of any culture, ethnicity, size, race, religious group, orientation, or gender identity. One of my goals as a therapist is to help you feel comfortable in your own skin. In addition to poly clients, I work with many other diverse groups including members the LGBTQQ community and size-diverse people. I often work with families and individuals around issues such as coming out, dealing with the end of a relationship, recovering from trauma, or living with a chronic illness. My office is fully accessible to people living with disabilities.





            Fees: I offer a brief, free telephone consultation to help us both evaluate whether I am the right therapist for you. As of November 2016, my fee is $130/session and I do not accept insurance (although I can provide paperwork for you to get reimbursed).  Please ask about current fees and insurance coverage when you contact me, as these may change.

        description: The impact of collective, historic and public events on lives marginalized by dominant cultures often goes unrecognized.  Especially for women, LGBT and queer-identified people, people of color and other people marginalized by dominant power paradigms, the body is often a site of cultural dislocation. By working directly with the cultural messages and lessons that have been integrated, often unconsciously, onto the body and psyche, we can begin to create new stories, meanings and choices about being members of our communities and cultures. In my psychotherapy practice I work with people of all genders in the exploration of relationships to the self, to others, and to the communities in which we live. I have extensive experience working with queer, genderqueer, activist, and multicultural communities, queer parents and prospective parents, as well as kink/BDSM and poly communities, and the spaces where these identities overlap. I also teach queer and multicultural psychology and supervise students beginning their clinical fieldwork.

            There are many reasons why you might be considering therapy at this time: a long-standing problem, the impact of a current life situation, and/or wanting support for your personal growth. Whatever your reasons, I know that it is important for you to find a therapist with whom you feel you can develop a good working relationship - someone whom you feel you can trust, who can understand your situation, someone with solid training and experience.





            In our work together we will come to understand more about the sense you may have that your life is not your own - feeling stuck, feeling driven by old habits, feeling depressed, feeling consumed and forestalled by rage, feeling that change is needed in your relationship or in your career.





            You and I will work together to build a trusting and non-judgmental relationship where you can feel safe to talk about yourself openly. The strength of our relationship is a crucial foundation for our work together. You know your life better than anyone else. Therefore, we will hold great respect for your wisdom about yourself. I will offer my professional knowledge and wisdom as well, and together, we will work to help you discover how to live the life that is best and most fitting for you. Please contact me for a free 15 minute phone consultation.





            I look forward to hearing from you.

        description: "Making the decision to begin therapy can be a difficult one. Whether it is to enter into therapy for the first time or to resume the process after a hiatus, I commend you for seeking assistance, counsel, and a compassionate ear.  The last thing you want to feel in a therapeutic environment is judged for your life style choices.\n\nI am committed to an open-minded non judgmental stance.  I have over 20 years of experience in this field and have an expertise in clients who are poly/kink/swingers.  \n\nThe art of therapy is knowing when to listen quietly and compassionately, when to offer up practical advice and tools, and/or when to bring up an unconscious dynamic that is unduly influencing the course of your direction. After 20 years of studying and practicing this art, I can offer you this subtle yet profoundly important expertise."

            Poly/kink friendly, extensive experience in the LGBTQ communities; specializing in trauma recovery, grief & loss, life transitions, anxiety, insomnia, social and sexual issues, spiritual concerns, non-traditional life styles, parenting, pre- and post-surgery recovery. I welcome adults, teens and children to my practice.





            I invite you to become an active agent in the story of your life. My intention is to assist you in strengthening your connection with yourself at a soul level and to support you in creating a life path that is fulfilling on a personal level as well as one which brings your unique gifts into our interconnected world.





            Through the use of hypnosis, you experience an altered state of consciousness that allows you to directly access your subconscious mind. By speaking to the subconscious in language it can easily hear you change patterns you have outgrown - creating new healthy images out of the old.





            You use an intention to work toward your personal goals, and you are the one who is controlling the process. As a result, you remove subconscious blocks and find guidance from within your deep self.





            In my practice I use Hypnotherapy by itself or combine it with Reiki, based on your personal choices and needs. The combined approach is especially helpful for physical manifestations of emotional issues or for supporting deep inner healing.





            Languages: English, German, Polish.  Sliding Scale available.

            I hope this space can help you begin to answer whether we might work well together. Being warm, caring, empathetic, and helpful is a core part of being a therapist, so I won't emphasize those qualities here. In terms of my more unique clinical facets, I endeavor to be nonjudgmental even when not neutral. I'm high energy, whimsical, and mirthful in the counseling room. I am also skilled at verbally describing internal decision-making and emotional processes and have excellent pattern recognition and analytical skills.





            Each individual comes to therapy with their own goals in mind and I'm here to work on whatever you feel would most benefit you. I especially enjoy supporting clients in discovering and supporting boundaries, building relationships and relationship agreements, and managing depression and suicidality.





            I won't judge you for consensual expressions of your identity and sexuality. I encourage LGBTQIA2-S people, people in consensual nonmonogamous relationships, BDSM/kink practitioners and community members, sex workers, and people living with chronic, severe depression and suicidality to reach out to me. I work with adults and partners. Please check my website for information about my availability for new self pay and insurance clients.

            Making the decision to see a therapist is not an easy one, and it often takes a fair amount of courage to do so. For those who decide that therapy is appropriate, the outcome can be positive, bringing them more intimacy and fulfillment. Therapy provides the opportunity to improve communication, reduce stress, anxiety and anger, and improve the most important relationship we have....the one we have with ourselves.

            I am a licensed therapist who has worked on the Peninsula for over 21 years. Issues I address include relationship struggles (both traditional and non-traditional), problems associated anxiety, depression and parenting. I also work with issues related to physical and sexual abuse.

            I focus on creating a safe, supportive and non-judgmental therapeutic experience. It is important to find the right therapist for you. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my work and to "interview me.

            Therapy is an amazing placebo. You do not NEED a therapist to learn, transform, and grow your awareness of yourself. I firmly believe whatever it is you are seeking to learn, change, or make peace with, you can do it. The benefit of working with a trained therapist who sees you, gives your sense of agency and innate wisdom the respect it deserves, and offers an outside perspective on your experience informed by evidenced-based theory and practice, is that the pace of growth is greatly accelerated.





            I arrived at clinical work after the suffering I uncovered in English and History overwhelmed me. What the long journey of higher education and years of practice have revealed is that the business of living is NOT figuring things out, but showing up. Authentic, full, vulnerable, and teachable.





            I'm a geek many times over, but I'm primarily a sex and systems geek. I am enthusiastic about work with couples, poly groups, and alternative sexualities. I invite you to encounter yourself and your relationships differently, using a combination of experiential and cognitive interventions.

            Description of Services:





            The world-wide expert on polyamorous families with children, Dr. Sheff provides expert witness services, writing and academic consulting, and relationship coaching. An expert in families of sex and gender minorities, Sheff can conduct interviews, review documents or reports, and provide assessments that distinguish between families that are merely unconventional and those that are truly problematic. Sheff can advise lawyers, prepare statements and court briefs, and provide testimony. In courtroom testimony, Sheff uses empirical data from her own and others' research to counter misinformation, prejudice, and fear about sex and gender minorities.





            Using her extensive knowledge of polyamory and kink/BDSM, Sheff provides one-time relationship consultations for those who wonder how polyamory or kink might impact their lives and ongoing coaching for those who are seeking an external perspective and strategies to deal with jealousy, set realistic boundaries, deal with conflict, and improve communication skills. Dr. Sheff can meet with you in person when possible, via telephone, or Skype.





            From universities to MeetUps and Cons, Dr. Sheff speaks to groups and organizations about sex and gender diversity, and how it relates to families, health, and laws. Sheff has provided keynote addresses at InfinityCon and Atlanta Poly Weekend, and presented at conferences from the American Psychiatric Association to the National Council on Family Relations as well as conventions like DragonCon and Frolicon.





            Author of three books, over 20 peer-reviewed publications, and hundreds of blogs on her own site and Psychology Today, Sheff provides writing services and uses her range of writing skills to help you create content for your website, write your book, or turn your masters thesis into a journal article.

            I am a Polyamory and Open Relationship Coach (https://poly-coach.com/). I work with individuals and couples in all kinds of relationships.  I specialize in open relationships, polyamory, and ethical non-monogamy because I am experienced in the lifestyle. That said, I have no desire or intention to convert anyone to polyamory. I support people in discovering what is in true alignment for themselves. I offer tools to help people learn how to cultivate relationships that resonate with their heart and soul.





            I've been in numerous teaching roles and capacities for the past 20 years. I attended a two-year coaching and apprenticeship program to learn how to help people break through limiting beliefs and patterns that kept them stuck in unhealthy relationships.  I work with clients all over the globe using Skype, Facetime, and other video formats.

            I offer individual, personalized sessions counseling and educating clients in intimacy, consciousness, and relationship/emotional skills to release guilt, fear, and shame. Sessions provide compassionate, somatic healing for sexuality and relationships so that clients can let into their lives all the love, pleasure, and freedom they have always wanted.





            Many have have deep healing to do, and many others do not identify as having any issues, but simply wish to enhance themselves, to go deeper with themselves. Sometimes a client wishes to learn and explore new things, new ways of expression and being that they might be afraid, ashamed, or unwilling to with their current relationship(s), and unable to by themselves.





            Scar tissue remediation (due to surgery, childbirth, injury, or illness) is also offered - I have been professionally trained to work directly with (internal and external) scar tissue.





            I accept referrals and work in collaboration with complementary and traditional professionals, therapists, medical doctors, social workers, and other health care providers.





            Serving Ireland, UK, Europe, and beyond.





            This is a judgement-free, sex-positive, kink-friendly offering. All abilities, sizes, sexual & relationship preferences, and orientations are loved, respected, and welcomed. I specialize in women and female-bodied individuals. However, my work helping people deepen their embodiment is available to all gender-identities and sexes.





            Fees are charged on a per session basis, with rates generally similar to what one would expect to pay for other highly experienced and trained specialist professionals. Specifics disclosed during initial consultation.





            PLEASE NOTE: Sexological Bodywork is not a sexual service and we do not act as surrogate partners. We remain fully clothed for the duration and any touch that occurs in our therapeutic education sessions is unidirectional - no reciprocal touch is permitted.

        description: Since 1985 I have worked in the human potential/healthcare field with people in many situations. My initial training was at a buddhist school and since then Jungian analytic and contemporary psychiatric training have also been very influential to how I work.  Polyamorous arrangements and sexuality/relatedness issues in general are issues which come up in my practice frequently, as well as other common challenges such as life choices, direction, and transitions, as well as mood, substance use, spirituality, attention and mindfulness, anxiety, and the like. I am happy to talk initially briefly by phone if you like to see if an initial meeting might make sense and be possible.  Sliding fee scale; flexible payment arrangements possible; many insurances accepted; out-of-network coverage likely for others.

I am licensed in California by the Board of Behavioral Sciences as a Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT), and in British Columbia as a Registered Clinical Counsellor (RCC). I have practiced since 1966. I work with people of all sexual orientations and relationship configurations who have sexual questions ranging from difficulties to enhancement.





            I affirm my commitment to personal, consensual, sexual rights and choices, gender equality and personal responsibility, and to the autonomy and empowerment of people regardless of gender or sexual orientation or expression. All individuals, couples and families have the right to decide, freely and responsibly, what part they want sexuality to play in their relationships. I have worked with many poly and kink couples and families.





            Many clients are now being seen via Skype.

            I work from psychodynamic and depth psychology perspectives primarily with adults and elders, specializing in the areas anxiety & depression, LGBT issues, and recovery from addiction.





            I have spent my career in LGBTQ Community & Mental Health and AIDS Services in Chicago and Seattle. I have a non-judgmental approach to my clients lifestyle and relationship choices. The question is not good or bad, but rather how their choices work or do not work for their lives.





            I am particularly interested in the integration of psychology and spirituality. I welcome consideration of my clients spiritual experience and religious history as part of the work. I am open to many ways of understanding this level of experience and I have no expectation that clients hold any particular faith perspective or, for that matter, any whatsoever.

            I offer individual, personalized sessions counseling and educating clients in intimacy, consciousness, and relationship/emotional skills to release guilt, fear, and shame. Sessions provide compassionate, somatic healing for sexuality and relationships so that clients can let into their lives all the love, pleasure, and freedom they have always wanted.





            Many have have deep healing to do, and many others do not identify as having any issues, but simply wish to enhance themselves, to go deeper with themselves. Sometimes a client wishes to learn and explore new things, new ways of expression and being that they might be afraid, ashamed, or unwilling to with their current relationship(s), and unable to by themselves.





            Scar tissue remediation (due to surgery, childbirth, injury, or illness) is also offered - I have been professionally trained to work directly with (internal and external) scar tissue.





            I accept referrals and work in collaboration with complementary and traditional professionals, therapists, medical doctors, social workers, and other health care providers.





            Serving Ireland, UK, Europe, and beyond.





            This is a judgement-free, sex-positive, kink-friendly offering. All abilities, sizes, sexual & relationship preferences, and orientations are loved, respected, and welcomed. I specialize in women and female-bodied individuals. However, my work helping people deepen their embodiment is available to all gender-identities and sexes.





            Fees are charged on a per session basis, with rates generally similar to what one would expect to pay for other highly experienced and trained specialist professionals. Specifics disclosed during initial consultation.





            PLEASE NOTE: Sexological Bodywork is not a sexual service and we do not act as surrogate partners. We remain fully clothed for the duration and any touch that occurs in our therapeutic education sessions is unidirectional - no reciprocal touch is permitted.

            I work from psychodynamic and depth psychology perspectives primarily with adults and elders, specializing in the areas anxiety & depression, LGBT issues, and recovery from addiction.





            I have spent my career in LGBTQ Community & Mental Health and AIDS Services in Chicago and Seattle. I have a non-judgmental approach to my clients lifestyle and relationship choices. The question is not good or bad, but rather how their choices work or do not work for their lives.





            I am particularly interested in the integration of psychology and spirituality. I welcome consideration of my clients spiritual experience and religious history as part of the work. I am open to many ways of understanding this level of experience and I have no expectation that clients hold any particular faith perspective or, for that matter, any whatsoever.

            I am Board certified as a Sex Therapist by numerous professional organizations. I am licensed in California by the Board of Behavioral Sciences as a Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT), and in British Columbia as a Registered Clinical Counsellor (RCC). I have practiced since 1966. I work with people of all sexual orientations and relationship configurations who have sexual questions ranging from difficulties to enhancement.





            I affirm my commitment to personal, consensual, sexual rights and choices, gender equality and personal responsibility, and to the autonomy and empowerment of people regardless of gender or sexual orientation or expression. All individuals, couples and families have the right to decide, freely and responsibly, what part they want sexuality to play in their relationships. I have worked with many poly and kink couples and families.





            Many clients are now being seen via Skype.

        description: "I treat a wide variety of complaints, both physical and emotional. I specialize in musculoskeletal dysfunction (back, neck, joint pain), stress/anxiety, & sleep disorders. My acupuncture is a pragmatic combination of TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine), Japanese style, Tan, ah shi, auricular, and scalp zone techniques.  OMM  (Osteopathic Musculoskeletal Manipulation, a type of medical massage) is based on retraining nerves and muscles to work properly again. Slow, gentle movements help reset the tension level of chronically tight muscles.. Scar tissue and fascial adhesions are also removed. Multiple techniques include Still, Trager, percussion, muscle energy, and myofascial release. Please see my website and blog ( RoseCityAcupuncture.com ) for more information and simple online scheduling.\n\n\n\n\n\nI serve humans of all flavors (all genders, orientations, abilities, kinks, relationship style, etc.). My office is ADA accessible.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Car accidents:** I can bill insurance companies directly.\n\n\n**Health insurance:**  Payment is requested at time of service. I can provide a coded medical receipt that you can submit for reimbursements. I will be considered an out-of-network provider. \n\n\n\n\n\nFor a first appointment I prefer an hour. 1 hr of acupuncture & massage is $90. Half hour of either one is $55.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscount packages available for multiple sessions. I do not have a sliding scale, but I do smoking cessation treatments for free ( http://rosecityacupuncture.com/blog/quitting-smoking/ ) and volunteer for the Returning Veterans program."

            Contemplative Psychotherapy is rooted in the belief that all people are born with the wisdom they need, known as your "brilliant sanity." As your therapist, I can help you uncover this rich resource and tap into your innate wisdom, promoting healing and improved well-being. With a decade of experience in meditation and mindfulness practice, I integrate Buddhist philosophy with modern Western psychology, bringing present moment awareness into our time together and focusing on our relationship as the tool for healing. While Western psychology often focuses on diagnoses and symptoms, Contemplative Psychotherapy views the effects of past trauma and emotional challenges as the barriers to accessing your internal wisdom and its healing potential. Together, we aim toward awakening the self as it fully is, complete with its pain and challenges, and its brilliance and beauty.





            I know that in navigating the world as a queer person, it can be challenging to find the right fit in a therapist. Whether you identify as non-binary, trans, genderfluid or anywhere on the spectrum of non-heteronormativity, it's critical to talk with someone who gets it. When it's time to further explore a facet of your identity, sexuality or relationship, you can feel safe expressing yourself with me as you are without your therapist assigning your struggles to your lifestyle or identity. I counsel sex workers, individuals in polyamorous or other multiple-partner relationships, and participants in kink or BDSM lifestyles. When you walk into my office, you can rest assured that you will be met with compassion and non-judgement.

Expect a respectful atmosphere with attention for all people involved.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt discussion/support group evenings, the main goal is to share, acknowledge and recognise ourselves in each other, and give tips if that's what someone asks. \n\n\n\n\n\n- Languages of all services: NL & EN. \n\n\n\n\n\n- Population I serve: people occupied with consensual non-monogamy, regardless of age, sexual orientation, ethnicity, etc. Though the focus lies specifically on polyamory and other consensual non-monogamies, I'd like to state explicitly that BDSM, tantra, feminism, LGBTQ, sex workers & partners, and other non-normative sexualities are welcome."

        description: "I am a licensed marriage and family therapist with a private practice, Awen Therapy,  in Middleton, WI. My primary area of focus is alternative sex and sexuality along with alternative relationship formations including all forms of ethical non-monogamy such as polyamory.  I am well equipped to work with a wide range of issues such as depression, anxiety, life transitions, decision making, and general life satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy primary therapeutic approach is experiential, meaning I help you get in touch with your emotions, learn how to regulate them and how to integrate them with logical decision making to support you making the best decisions for yourself. I believe that we are happiest when we know our desires well and make decisions from a wise-mind state that incorporates both logic and emotion.\n\n\n\n\n\nI work with adults and adolescents. I have experience not only helping individuals integrate polyamory into their lives but also supporting polyamorous parents. In addition to my therapy practice I periodically write for various blogs and publications and have presented workshops at various poly and poly-friendly conferences. \n\n\n\nI provide online services as well as in person. I offer online coaching for anyone not in Wisconsin. Take advantage of a free 30 minute consultation in person, by phone, or online to see if we would be a good fit. You can schedule a free consultation, intake, or ongoing sessions online at my website awentherapy.com."

        description: "I offer individual, couples or group counseling for a variety of mental health issues. My specialty is working with couples and sex therapy. This can include: financial problems, parenting/co-parenting, affairs, boundary setting, sexual problems, ED, PE, Painful intercourse, transitioning, life changes, premarital counseling, etc. More specifically, I have been trained to work with more that one person in therapy. Most counselors have only been trained to work with one person and struggle with how to manage couples or even multiple people in romantic relationships. \n\n\n\n\n\nI also understand that poly clients are not always coming to therapy to discuss their romantic relationships. Sometimes, poly clients would like to address problems unrelated to their sex life in an environment that is free from judgment for their lifestyle choices. I can offer this service as well. I work with adults 18+ of any race, ethnicity, religious, or cultural background. I am LGBTQI friendly. \n\n\n\n\n\nI am in network currently with Blue Cross/Blue Shield. My private fee is based on the length of a session. I charge $120 per 45 minute increment. I offer 45 minute sessions, 1.5 hour sessions, or 3 hour sessions. Insurance only covers 45 minute sessions. I do not offer sliding scale, but will offer discounts for people who will to pay in advance for multiple appointments. Ask your therapist for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I have a good sense of humor.  I run a YouTube channel and podcast called \"The About Sex Podcast.\" It can be found on google play or ITunes.  In this podcast, we playfully discuss a variety of sexual health topics. My goal is to educate people about sex in a way that is fun, meaningful, and helpful. For clients unsure if they will work well with me, they can listen to my podcast to get to know me before setting a therapy session."

            I view therapy as the process of assisting unbroken people to live in a world that is broken. At Soaring Heart Counseling, I rediscover sexuality, restore relationships and help you recover from your past. I've worked with a wide variety of people throughout my career, with a special focus on teenagers and young adults, PTSD, drug and alchol recovery, transgender issues, BDSM and ethical non-monagomy.





            I work with individuals, couples, and polycules of all configurations. I am working towards becoming an AASECT certified sex therapist, and I am already certified in EMDR. My approaches to therapy blend the insight orientation of older theories with the latest cognitive and behavioral based strategies. My approach to work with couples or polycules is based on the research of John Gottman and the various books about polyamory available today. Please visit my website for additional information.





            I serve all ages from older teens to older adults. Sessions are $95 for 45-50 minutes. I am in-network with several private insurance companies as well. The easiest way to schedule an appointment is through my website.

I believe passionately in the right to sexual expression for <i>every body</i> and specialize in pelvic pain and education and advocacy with people with disabilities and illness.\n\n\n\n\n\nSexuality is a complex identity including relational, physiological, and emotional elements, but it is rooted in the lived experience of the body.  I am particularly passionate about providing support when our bodies change.  Perhaps things \"just don't work the same way\" after surgery, injury, medical treatment, or the onset of chronic illness.  Or perhaps sexual response and pleasure sensations are reduced after childbirth. Sexological Bodywork creates a safe container in which these concerns can be safely explored, understood, and transformed.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe nothing has changed, per say...you just know there has to be more to your sexuality.  You desire to connect deeply with your own desire, to REALLY know what you want, and to be able to express that to your partner(s).  Together we can increase your capacity to experience and savor pleasure and develop the confidence and communication skills you need to bring your new-found pleasures into your intimate relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy practice is trauma informed, and I am deeply committed to the primacy of emotional expression in the healing and learning processes.  All of you is welcome in our sessions!  But I never lose sight of the fact that your sexual yearnings and needs are rooted in and reaching for JOY.  With \"reverent irreverence\" and a profound sense of play, I am honored to support your journey to manifest your fullest vision of your erotic self.\n\n\n\n\n \nPoly, queer, kink, and sex-worker friendly.  Please email or call to schedule a complimentary 30 minute phone consultation!"

        description: I specialize in working with relatively high-functioning individuals, couples or family members with a history of various forms of trauma, such as emotional abuse and neglect, physical or sexual abuse, spiritual/religious abuse, grief/loss and abandonment. Within these areas, many of my clients have been oppressed because of their gender, sexual orientation, romantic/sexual lifestyle, race/ethnicity or other area of self-identification. I enjoy helping clients strengthen their self-awareness, feel empowered, learn to make conscious/intentional life decisions and develop healthy relationships. I work with anyone over the age of 13.

            My primary goal is to help people be happier in their lives and relationships.





            I offer Personal Therapy and Couples/Relationship Therapy in San Diego, CA. I am caring, non-judgmental, and empathetic and my approach to therapy is collaborative - my role is to be a catalyst for the change you desire. I help individual (age 18+) with anxiety, depression, life transitions, and personal growth.





            For couples/relationship therapy, I specialize in Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT), which is shown to be one of the most effective therapies for couples. This type of therapy is geared toward the importance of attachment bonds, recognizing the cycles where you may feel stuck, and learning how to change the way you and your partner relate to each other in a meaningful way.





            I also have a background in Sexology and am comfortable and willing to discuss topics about sexuality in a non-judgmental and frank manner. These topics may include issues or concerns with sexual health, healing from infidelity, increasing intimacy, re-igniting passion, sexual compatibility, and improving mutual sexual satisfaction.





            I help people from a variety of relationship dynamics, and I am very familiar with the diversity of lifestyle and relationships found today. Whether you are single, in a primary relationship, triad, quad, V, non-hierarchical, or any other love constellation, I provide a safe space to discuss delicate topics and I strive to make each of my clients feel comfortable and understood.





            *Please note: I am active in the local community and occasionally attend local social events. So if you also attend local community events, we may know many of the same people. If this is an issue, please let me know upfront and I will do my best to provide with a more appropriate referral for you.

            The mission of Choices Counseling and Consulting is the providing competent psychotherapeutic care to all individuals and families.All associates at Choices are trained in general psychotherapy and family therapy, holding Master's degrees in Social Work or Psychology. We are skilled in traditional psychotherapeutic modalities, as well as holistic and psychospiritual approaches. Although individual practitioners have different training and focus, associates all work within a feminist and family systems framework, with additional specialization in various other modalities. We work with families, couples, children, and youth.





            In addition to general training in psychology, the staff at Choices specializes in issues related to sexual orientation, sexuality, and gender identity and expression. Our focus always begins with respect to people's unique racial, ethnic, cultural backgrounds, sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions, and dis/abilities. Our clinicians draw from training and therapeutic skills that recognize, validate, and celebrate diversity as a means to create safe and welcoming spaces for all persons. Understanding that each of these aspects of identity exists on a spectrum, we affirm and respect every client's right to self-identify and authenticity.





            Choices welcomes all individuals and couples, including those who are lesbian and gay and bisexual or queer. We work with transgender people, including gender non-conforming children and youth, and gender-queer identified. Additionally, we offer culturally competent counseling for those who are poly and those who identify with alternative (kink) sexuality.





            What is unique about Choices is our commitment to couples and families who are LGBTQ identified. We recognize that diversity among and within families is extremely positive. Family values are at the core of our therapy.

            If you are struggling in your relationships with partner(s), family members, coworkers, or friends; if you are trying to change self-destructive thoughts and patterns of behavior; if you are experiencing constant anxiety and worry, you deserve nonjudgmental, unhurried, confidential treatment to uncover, address, and change the aspects of your life that are causing your distress. Using techniques from psychoanalysis and psychotherapy, I will work with you to create long-lasting changes in your outlook, behaviors, relationships, and life.





            I welcome individuals facing any issues to contact me for a free consultation to determine our compatibility in working together. I have extensive experience with the particular difficulties faced by the nonmonogamous, polyamorous, BDSM, kink, LGBT, and queer communities.

        description: "My approach is a flexible, organic experience of healing for many emotional concerns, particularly anxiety, sadness, grief, fear, shame, anger, loneliness, guilt, sexual and creative blockages. We work to bring the hidden into light. That which has caused you to distort your inner strength can be brought to the foreground and choices can be made. I embrace all gender expressions and sexual orientations. I have experience supporting a variety of relationship configurations and lifestyles, and can assist in navigating issues that can surface in these choices, such as boredom, jealousy, intimacy blockages, differing needs and desires, sexual and emotional satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\n\nInfluenced by the works of Fritz Perls, Wilhelm Reich and Rollo May, I will help you explore what has been fed to you and become indigestible. We will work to move through the layers of pain towards a new, authentic expression of Self.\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe that we are continually remaking and creating ourselves and our experiences. Sometimes we do this without awareness, and suffer from self-deception and distortion. The goal is for you to become aware of what you are doing, how you are doing it, and how you can change.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividuals: Individual work is core to my practice. I work with adults and adolescents.  Together we can explore whatever you feel to be disturbing your experience of life, particularly depression, anxiety, grief, loneliness, spiritual and creative blocks, illness, childhood abuse, trauma or issues related to sexuality, gender expression, and intimacy. \n\n\n\n\n\nCouples: In working with couples, I assist my clients in their exploration of relationship. I work with intimate partners, siblings, business partners and friendship pairs. I am particularly drawn towards working with couples who are in the process of changing the way they experience relationship, whether that change is one of coming together, or moving apart.\n\n\n\n\n\nFamilies and Groups: I have a broad definition of family, ranging from the traditional nuclear family to families of choice and nontraditional configuration. I can assist you in exploring the patterns that sometimes interfere with the healthy functioning of the family system.  I also work with groups, some short term, and others long term. Please inquire for further information about newly forming groups, and groups open to new members.\n\n\n\n\n\nAreas of Specialty: Depression, Sadness, Loneliness and Grief; Anxiety; Career and Life Transitions ; Men's Issues; Business Partner Struggles; Sexuality, Intimacy and Relationship Concerns; LGBT, Kink and Queer Community Issues; Spiritual Exploration; Shame; HIV and AIDS; Addiction and Compulsive Behaviors; Adult Children of Alcoholics; End of Life Issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nEleven years in practice.

            I use a Mindfulness & Cognitive Behavioral approach to helping my clients work through issues that come up in their Non Traditional lifestyles.





            I believe that human nature in its many forms is always evolving and if we are able to harness and lean into this change and learn to grow in healthy ways we can become our best selves. I seek to build a positive therapeutic relationship with all my clients to better comprehend the problems that they may be dealing with in their lives and attempt to assist them in finding healthy resolutions.





            I use an eclectic approach so that I can meet each client where they are on their own personal path of life. I lean heavily on the cognitive-behavioral theory for its distinction between behaviors and thoughts and the narrative theory for its explanation of how we all use stories to interpret our lives.





            I create a personalized working theory for each client to better integrate the most appropriate techniques to achieve the client's goals. I see my role as one of facilitation and guide to assist the client in finding where it is they need to go to fix their own problems. I believe the counselor should encourage the growth of their clients, while providing a safe and confidential space for them to explore the unhealthy thinking and irrational beliefs that underpin their issues.

            I work as relationship counselor and personal coach in Dresden, Germany. I am qualified psychologist and specialized on alternative relationships. A big amount of my clients belong to the poly-scene in Germany.





            The aim of my work is to find the very special way for every couple, triad, polygon... and any other relationship, that makes the people involved as happy and satisfied as possible. In that process I treat every form of relationship equally and I don't judge people's choice to love and live. I don't consider any problem as problem of a special form of relationship. Rather I see it as a very special problem of the people involved, that demands a special solution in their special context. Another part of my work is to accompany couples on their way to open up their relationship and to help new-to-poly partners to find their position/satisfaction in an existent relationship system.





            I offer Face-to-Face Counseling in the German cities Dresden and Leipzig and also Online/Email  and Telephone Counselling for clients in other parts of Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

I have also studied sexuality and relationships in various disciplines on my own and through Brain and Mind Studies. I myself am sexually-variant, Black with Cherokee and Irish blood, demisexual, kinky, autistic, invisibly disabled, aromantic, genderqueer, and more.





            If you'd like an article or consult, my rate is $100 per session/article.





            Additionally, I offer various courses/classes to universities, conventions, and other events: ranging from Intersectional Non-Monogamy to How to Write Cuil Fiction to The Sexual Spectrum. See my speaker page for available courses. I'll consider discounts for marginalized populations but my average honorarium is $3500 (not including travel and expenses).





            In addition to the website above, I am also online at http://michonneal.com/ and http://cuileffect.com

        description: I specialize in counseling gender and sexual minorities, people in alternative relationship models (partnered non-monogamy/polyamory) and traditional monogamous relationship issues such as infidelity, mistrust and ineffective communication. I also work with people who have been previously diagnosed or suspect they have a sex or porn addiction. I believe any problematic sexual behavior is a symptom of a deeper rooted problem that needs to be addressed rather than the cause of the concern. My passion is in supporting community members while also educating and training other professionals. I do individual and relationships sessions as well as groups and workshops.

        description: "I believe that each person has infinite wisdom within themselves to address life's challenges. Sometimes we lose access to that wisdom; I see my role as helping clients to reconnect with it. My goal as a therapist is to compassionately assist my clients in realizing their strengths and to cultivate self-compassion. \n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing heavily from strength-based and narrative therapeutic approaches, I have worked with adolescents, children, adults, couples and families.  I have extensive experience working with survivors of trauma, whether it be familial, societal, or medical in nature.  I seek to create a safe space for people experiencing marginalization such as GLBTQ clients as well as those who identify as non-monogamous or kinky. \n\n\n\n\n\nOftentimes, these experiences are isolating, but you do not have to feel alone."

            I provide non-judgmental, neutral and safe mediation services to folks who need help working through difficult subjects, making agreements around open-relationships, discussing relationship hopes and dreams and fears, and general assistance in improving communication.  I am sex-positive and LQBTQ friendly. I help you identify what areas you want to be heard on, discuss and work through and support you and your partner(s) to have constructive conversations about what is most meaningful to you all. I also offer communication coaching and tools for making talking about the hard stuff a little bit easier. As a mediator I am a neutral third party that is equally partial to all folks in a discussion and I help people wade through the hard parts of conflict to get to the heart of an issue and find their way to resolution and clarity.  Most mediations range from two to three hours to allow for each person to really feel heard, seen and cared for.






            Professional specialties and skills: Mediation, Conflict resolution, Restorative Justice, Peacemaking Circles, Group Dialogue Facilitation, Conflict and Communication Coaching.  Speaks English and basic Spanish.  I work remotely via Skype or in-person in the San Francisco Bay Area.

I work with people individually and within their relationships, according to their desires and needs for therapy.  As a kink-aware and poly-friendly therapist I won't assume that the issue that brings you to therapy is caused by your kink or poly orientation.  I will be interested in your desire for change and your definition of success, rather than imposing someone else's ideals upon you.  I will be curious about whether/how your sexual identity and lifestyle affect other areas and relationships in your life.  I can help you to clarify the boundaries of your poly/BDSM relationship and create an agreement that honors the needs and wishes of you and your partner(s).  I have a high standard for my work and consult regularly with colleagues who are also sensitive to the needs of the kink/poly community.

            Hello, I am Michael Guichet, a licensed psychotherapist, specializing in sex therapy. I work to help individuals, partners, and couples to connect on the things that are not being talked about. Often people believe they are broken or their desires are shameful and I work to create change and facilitate communication. Let me work with you on changing the patterns in your life.





            Specializing in sex therapy means I work with individuals, couples, partners, and families in monogamous, Poly, open, LGBTQQIA, kink, and BDSM communities. I also work with sexual dysfunction and disorder. It is my passion to work to heal shame and facilitate communication around my client's identity, relationship orientation, sexual orientation, sexual behavior, and many more aspects of the sexual experience.





            I am Poly and open knowledgeable, kink and BDSM knowledgeable, LGBT affirming, queer affirming, asexual affirming, and sex worker friendly.  I can do teletherapy (therapy over the internet) in the state of California.

        description: As a therapist, I am highly versed in working with many different polyamorous dynamics and relationship constellations. Particular specializations of mine include working with polyamory in the LGBTQIA populations, BDSM and kink identities, and developing strong, sex positive, healthy relationships. I specialize in working with Gender, Sexuality, and Sex Therapy with individuals, relationships, and families. Entwine Therapy is founded on the idea that all aspects of our lives are connected. When we are stunted or limited in one space of life, we cannot truly express ourselves in the other places, hindering us from being the most authentic version of ourselves. Equally, finding full expression and growth in challenging areas of life creates a network of personal development in other avenues. At Entwine Therapy, I focus on facilitating growth for individuals and relationships so they can gain a greater sense of equilibrium and excellence in their lives. I am dedicated to helping you build strong relationships with yourself and others, and healing fractures in healthy development that hinder achieving your own excellence. I believe that every individual's story is unique and valuable. You are choosing to take brave step in the direction of your own growth!

We believe that health care is a human right. If you are a low-income family, please inquire about our sliding scale.

            Davis Senseman founded Davis Law Office out of a desire to make quality legal representation accessible to all business owners, no matter their size or experience. From that foundation, the firm has grown to include estate planning, litigation, and family law matters, while continuing to provide assistance in all areas to business owners and non-profits.





            When forming the firm (and when hiring) it was Davis' goal to do things differently, to create a law firm where the phrase "that's the way it's always been" could not be used as a reason to avoid innovation. She also hoped to create a firm where lawyers could enjoy themselves and actually care about the clients they worked with.  In adding to the team, Davis found like-minded attorneys dedicated to transparency in pricing and process, who also value being a part of the team of trusted advisors for their clients.





            Davis Law Office has tailored our services to address the specific and ever-evolving needs of modern families, individuals and business owners and will continue to find innovative ways to continue our commitment to accessibility.

        description: "My practice serves adults and teens in NC and throughout the state of NC over telehealth during Covid-19. I lead with values of intersectional feminism, sex-positivity, and trauma-informed care. Although I could list off several modalities that I use in practice (like compassionate-focused therapy, ACT, etc), I am far more interested in developing rapport with clients than I am pushing any kind of specific agenda or therapeutic model. My approach is non pathologizing and I encourage others to remain curious about the diversity of human experience. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe practice is currently working towards accepting BCBS and Aetna. \n\n\n\n\n\nIt's easy to contact us through our website by phone, email, or even sending a request for an appointment."

        description: Do you keep on getting hooked in the same relationship dynamics and can't figure out why you keep getting so triggered in relationships?  Or maybe you want to deepen into intimacy and keep finding barriers to getting closer either within you or a partner.  I am a somatically trained counselor focused on helping people use the wisdom of the body to heal from trauma. I have special interest in the fields of attachment and neuroscience and have extensive training in Sensorimotor Psychotherapy. I help my clients to mindfully study their organization of experience and experiment during the therapy hour with what the triggers are and how to resolve where the trigger originally came from (often a past traumatic event or developmental/attachment wound).  Together, we go beyond talking about it into resolving it deep within the body, mind, and spirit.  My approach is warm, gentle, welcoming, and collaborative.  I hold a safe and supportive space for people of all sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions, and come from a feminist perspective that welcomes and celebrates all unique beings equally.

The title would be "Hakkoryu Jujutsu master instructor (Shihan)", and "Koho Shiatsu Igaku (medical) certified practitioner". All certifications through authorized schools in Japan, however, and either have no similar thing in the US, or generally not recognized in US (shiatsu, as separate from, say, general massage).

I believe therapy is a profoundly unique space where you have the opportunity to connect, feel deeply listened to and understood, and have another human show up for you emotionally and empathically. *All of you is welcome here.*

My areas of expertise include work with LGBTQ+ people and relationships, specifically including trans and gender nonconforming individuals, non-monogamous and poly relationships, individuals who practice/engage in kink/bdsm, fetish sexualities, and issues relating to sex & sexuality.

        description: 'The number of polyamory, LGBTQIA and kink friendly therapists is increasing, hopefully eclipsing decades of shame inflicted by the mental health professions. We are in a time where relationship structures and gender are being redefined. People are experimenting with their attachments and desires. Over my near 20 years of licensed practice, I''ve worked with many types of poly development presented by clients: monogamies that want to open, or close, or repair the pain caused by either move; advanced poly relationships involving six adults and multiple contracts; cheating monogamists hoping to reset using polyamory best practices, and more. With lengthy training in a rigorous, integrated sex-positive relationship therapy model,  my clients'' relational, erotic/sexual and gender diversity is treated with a clear approach which understands the fundamental drive wheels of all choice-based relationships.'

            I take a pluralistic approach to psychotherapy, focusing first and foremost on the problems that a client brings to counselling and how they would like to address these. I specialize in working with gender and sexual minority clients and people involved in BDSM and/or polyamorous relationships. I'm passionate about helping people to create the relationships they want, whether that is rebuilding and repairing trust, opening up or closing their relationships.





            Integrity, honesty and compassion are the cornerstones of my practice. My work as a coach supports people in customizing their relationships and attending to the needs, desires and boundaries of everyone involved. Most of my work is online, using Skype, FaceTime or Zoom. I am open to working by email or chat for clients that prefer these methods of communication.





            I offer dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) skills groups tailored to consensually non monogamous clients. These groups are all about learning skills that help with building relationships and coping with difficult emotions. You can find out more here: https://loveuncommon.com/dbt-for-non-monogamy/

            However you structure your relationships, sometimes it's good to have some help. You may want to deal with an immediate issue, either for yourself or for your relationship. Or you may want to explore the emotional or spiritual side of what you do. Either way, you may discover pleasantly surprising things about your interior life.






            Joe Turner works with adults and elders with a wide range of life styles and orientations. We may work with patterns of thinking, or with your deep emotions. We can include emotionally supportive hypnotherapy if that's appropriated. Your needs set the pace. There's no fee to chat, to see if you feel a personal match. Contact me today.

            My main area of clinical focus is around men's issues and also with members of the LGBTQ community. I'm committed to providing a safe and affirming environment where you can process your feelings, no matter how difficult or uncomfortable.  I'm an active therapist and work collaboratively to help you increase self-awareness and identify a healthier path. Additionally, I draw on different theoretical approaches to adapt my work to your needs, but work primarily from a relational psychodynamic perspective.





            In my clinical work, I provide individual and relationship counseling services to adolescents and adults. I work with many different presenting concerns including mood & anxiety disorders, identity development, relationship issues, anger management, life transitions, grief, trauma, multicultural issues, and concerns about sexuality or substance use.





            I'm committed to creating an environment which promotes openness and trust where all beliefs and relationships can be freely explored. I work to provide services that are culturally sensitive; to create an atmosphere of acceptance of unique individual differences; and to provide culturally relevant services unique to each client's needs.

My work includes traditional family law subjects like divorce, custody, pre-marital agreements, and civil protection orders. It also includes using legal methods to protect the rights and interests of polyamorous people and others whose relationships worth protecting are not necessarily marital. Other areas I am experienced in include contract drafting and review, bankruptcy, immigration, and negotiation and dispute resolution. I run a lean operation and so am able to offer rates on the low end for the DC area.

            Are you nervous about the process of couples or individual therapy?  Have you heard that  therapy is hard or painful?  Maybe it makes you uncomfortable to let a stranger into your world because you fear you will be judged or branded as the person who has caused all of the problems in the relationship.





            Let me assure you that I am a genuine person, and I want our time together to feel like you are having a conversation with a trusted confidant.  My job is to make you feel comfortable, supported and safe so we can figure out together how to make your relationship better.  I have no agenda or desire to figure who is wrong in the relationship.  Blame doesn't create good outcomes, so we won't even go there.





            My style of therapy is very much like my personality:  down to earth, humble, funny, slightly sarcastic, direct, and blunt in a loving way.  I have a sense of humor about myself, and I encourage my clients to adopt the same attitude.  I hope you come away with the feeling I am really invested in you.  Telling me your thoughts and feeling won't scare me, surprise me or make me judge you.





            My office is a place to find support, empathy, and outside-of-the-box ways of thinking about problems.  I have extensive experience with couples who are working through addiction recovery, want pre-marital counseling, and/or are LGBTQIA identified.  I also love working with couples and individuals who struggle with being people pleasers and find it difficult to ask for their needs in relationships.





            I am incredibly enthusiastic and tend to be an overachiever working with clients who are motivated and open to change.  I've invested in the highest level of training because I truly want your relationship to be a success.  I have some great tools I can share with you to get your conversations moving in a new direction.





            Gottman level 3 trained, domestic violence trainer, substance abuse, addictions, and trauma. (CV on website if needed). Works with LBGTQIA, poly-affirming, couples and individuals.

        description: "Alex Caroline Robboy is the founder of The Center for Growth, Sex Therapy in Philadelphia. We are a group of sex positive therapists and psychiatrists who offer individual, couples, family therapy and medication management. We work clients struggling with anger, anxiety, compulsions, depression, grief, personality disorders, trauma, relationship issues, sexual function / dysfunction and alternative lifestyles. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe believe that each individual is unique and has the potential to achieve a fulfilling and rewarding life. There is no one best way of living; however, there are techniques and attitudes each of us can adopt to experience more pleasure and achieve an increased level of satisfaction. We define success not by how one completes a particular task, but rather by how one keeps going after a set-back. It is often only through failure that the real learning begins.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the process of life mistakes are inevitable. We believe that people who are motivated can learn and grow from their mistakes. It is our belief that there is no right way to go through life -- only your way.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrained therapists at the Center for Growth, Inc., are available to work with clients at all stages of life on a wide range of issues to help them achieve greater fulfillment and derive more satisfaction from life."

I offer a variety of tools, ideas and techniques for couples who are new to open relationships. I want to help you find the relationship structure that works for you and your partner(s).

            I offer sex and relationship coaching to individuals and couples in the Los Angeles area, or via Skype from anywhere in the world. I am passionate about providing a safe space for you to explore and ultimately discover the truest version of yourself. I specialize in working with, and am strongly connected to, the LGBTQIA+, kink, and non-monogamous communities.





            Sex coaching is a client-centered, holistic approach to assist you in reaching your sexual potential and embracing your authentic sexual self. Unlike therapy, coaching is collaborative and solutions-based. Using a combination of educational resources, philosophy, physiology, and mindfulness, I work with individuals and couples to release shame, heighten pleasure, and increase knowledge.





            I offer reasonable hourly rates, as well as discounted multi-session packages and a sliding scale. Please contact me to find the option that works best for you. A complimentary discovery call (15-20 minutes) is available prior to our first session to answer your questions and ensure that sex coaching is right for you.

        description: I focus primarily on family law and am eager to work with polyamorous clients. My work includes traditional family law subjects like divorce, custody, pre-marital agreements, and civil protection orders. It also includes using legal methods to protect the rights and interests of polyamorous people and others whose relationships worth protecting are not necessarily marital. Other areas I am experienced in include contract drafting and review, bankruptcy, immigration, and negotiation and dispute resolution. I run a lean operation and so am able to offer rates on the low end for the DC area.

I believe that because we are complex and unique individuals, an approach that integrates both mind and body is essential for the healing, growth, and resiliency that is the goal of therapeutic counseling. Treatment specializations include: Therapy for depression and anxiety, couples counseling, children and adolescents, work and career issues, stress and/or pain management, life transitions, self-esteem, mental illness/mental health issues, gender and/or sexual identity, and LGBTQIA-lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual communities.





            I found the most effective success lies is understanding the challenges from my clients perspective, and then relying on practical tools for breaking destructive cycles and habits, digesting difficult emotional experience and improving overall quality of life. We work collaboratively to develop a plan that embraces change, growth, and resiliency.





            I aspire to understand the complexities of each client while utilizing the Western psychological model and integrating research on the mind-body connection to embrace healing. I am a Registered Yoga Teacher and a CA BBS licensed Marriage and Family Therapist.

            I'm Dr. Liz from sexpositivepsych.com, and I believe great sex can change the world.  I'm a sex educator, speaker, and regular guest on several podcasts as part of my mission to help you have more meaningful, pleasurable relationships in life and work, as well as the bedroom.





            As a licensed psychologist who specializes in non-traditional relationships, I can tell you that the more honest and real you are about what turns you on, the easier it is to find a partner that understands you and wants to be with you - the real you.





            I coach couples and singles, whether gay or straight, polyamorous or monogamous, or even if you're still trying to figure it all out. I help you be who you are. Because being confident in who you are is the gateway to great relationships and great sex - and great sex can change the world.





            I currently offer both in-office and video chat or telephone sessions. I can see clients who live anywhere in California for therapy or anywhere in the world for coaching. I do my work in English but would be willing to discuss translation services.  I offer all potential clients a free phone call to see if we're the right fit; you can book this call at bit.ly/drlizpow.

            I work with individuals, couples, and families (whether by blood or chosen). I don't subscribe to one particular theory or way that therapy should "work".  I'm eclectic in my approach and believe in a strengths perspective. Focusing on how you have done things well, what you are proud of, and how you have made it thus far in your life is as important, if not more so, then what you feel may be wrong at this point. I strive to help people feel better, more connected, and more in tune with themselves and those around them.





            I am trained a sex therapist by Dr. Domeena Renshaw and I provide sex therapy around a wide range of issues including but not limited to: sexual intimacy problems, low sex drive, or differing sex drives in relationships, BDSM/kink, polyamorous or non-monogamous relationships, sexual issues related to chronic illnesses such as cancer, stroke, HIV/AIDS & depression, gender identity & LGBTQI communities.  As a consultant and trainer, I am passionate about educating medical providers to be culturally competent, specifically as it relates to gender & sexuality issues, so that no person feels like they have to educate their health care provider themselves in order to receive competent services.

            As a Gestalt therapist, I am very interested in the here and now. How are you stopping yourself from manifesting a fully functional and fulfilling life? When we restrict our awareness, we limit our possibilities for growth and a meaningful existence.





            I enjoy working with the taboo, the forbidden. Many of my clients live alternative lives. You are who you are. The work, as I see it, is to accept who you are and get on with enjoying yourself and your life.





            For many years, I have worked in the field of family law, counseling hundreds of clients through divorce, custody battles and domestic violence. These experiences, and many others, led me to become a therapist.





            I work with individuals and people in relationships of various types (couples, triads, etc.). I specialize in: LGBTQQIA issues, Sex and sexuality issues, Polyamory, Kink, Grief, Trauma, Elders & Aging, and Intimate Partner Violence.

        description: "I'm a member of Bloom Psychotherapy NYC, a group private practice that provides gender and sexuality expansive therapy, in the heart of NYC. I work with adults (individuals, and couples/intimate partnerships including polyamorous and non-monogamous relationships) on any part of gender and/or sexuality exploration. Whether you are just starting your journey of exploration and want extra support, or you are comfortable with your exploration and want a therapist to whom you don't have to educate on basics of your identities, I'm here to help you be your most authentic self - whatever that looks like. \n\n\n\n\n\nI also specialize in providing therapy to transgender and gender non-conforming children and adolescents, regardless of where your child is in their journey of exploration. In addition I work with children coming from polyamorous/non-monogamous families, as well as other non-traditional family structures such as blended families, and families going through separation or divorce.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFinally, I understand that our society is set up in such a way that certain people are valued more than others. Those people that are valued more benefit from certain privileges. I know that systemic racism, oppression, transphobia, sexism, ableism, homophobia, and more are not your fault, but can impact your life and contribute to your mental health. I am well-versed in working with people of color and understand how we often hold more than one identity at any given moment in our lives, and how that impacts how we navigate our worlds."

            The focus of my practice is relationship and sexual issues. I work with individuals, couples, dyads, and constellations. For poly folks I can help with forging agreements, healing broken agreements, infidelity, jealousy, kink, cultivating compersion, poly desire discrepancy (one person wants it, the other doesn't), family structure and discernments, mono-poly relationships, and many more issues.  I often use two simple but powerful questions to sort through the interweaving threads of needs and feelings, "What kind of partner do you want to be?" then I help you be it right now and "What kind of relationship(s) do you want to create?" then I help you figure out how to create the invitation for it right now. My style is active, emotionally focused, and practical. I jump in and offer suggestions, I help you speak from your heart not your head, and I give and follow-up on homework assignments to help you improve your relationship.





            As a poly person myself, I've experienced many common challenges including dating, calendaring, processing fatigue, introducing partners to kids, and yes, of course, jealousy. I also serve clients with a variety of other demographic and sexual diversities on issues less directly related to sex or relationships like anxiety, OCD, ADHD, and depression. You can read about my theories of communication and relationships and my style on my blog (www.drericfitz.com/blog/).





            I serve adults typically aged 24-65+ though I'm open to working with younger adults too. I only speak English. I am a member of the American Association of Sex Educators Counselors and Therapists, a sex positive professional organization.

            Life Transitions (for example: young adulthood, new marriage, new parenting, job loss & change, retirement); Reproductive Health Issues (examples: pondering parenthood, conception difficulties, miscarriage, perinatal mood & anxiety disorders, changes related to middle age and older); Living with a Creative Mind; Experiencing Life as the Underdog, Black Sheep, or Otherwise Different from Those Around You; Spirituality Issues; Anxiety & Depression.





            I see clients ranging in age from late teens and beyond. All genders (or none).  I work from a foundational training in Collaborative Dialogical Approach, Narrative, and Solution-Focused Therapy, and additional experience in Mindfulness and DBT.





            I offer clients the time and space to be heard, with open-minded compassion and decades of experience. I work collaboratively with clients toward the results they seek. Affordably. Seeking counseling can be an act of bravery, wisdom, and desperation. I have immense respect for individuals, couples, and families who make the choice to resolve their difficult issues.





            I also offer online counseling (client must be located in state of Texas), discounts for teachers and medical professionals, and for some, a unique program called 20 for $20 -- when an otherwise stable client just needs a quick 20-minute check-in to be heard.

My training and experience includes how to integrate emotional, spiritual and sexual dimensions of ourselves, depth psychology, family and human systems, generative trance, breath work, mindfulness and a familiarity with a broad range of special challenges you may be encountering as someone enjoying or exploring poly and alternate/queer sexuality and lifestyles.

I specialize in open relationships, polyamory, and ethical non-monogamy because I am experienced in the lifestyle. That said, I have no desire or intention to convert anyone to polyamory. I support people in discovering what is in true alignment for themselves. I offer tools to help people learn how to cultivate relationships that resonate with their heart and soul.





            I've been in numerous teaching roles and capacities for the past 20 years. I attended a two-year coaching and apprenticeship program to learn how to help people break through limiting beliefs and patterns that kept them stuck in unhealthy relationships.  I work with clients all over the globe using Skype, Facetime, and other video formats.

        description: "I am a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist who works with individuals, couples, triads etc, friendships and fluid bonded poly communities. My priority as a therapist is to create a safe space for you. When any of us seeks out therapy, we are likely suffering. To suffer is to be in a very tender place, and I want to honor that. Whether your suffering comes from early childhood trauma, more recent losses, relationship problems, social injustice, adjustment to big changes in your life... I want you to feel safe and companioned as you move toward tending those places of wounding and toward healing. \n\n\n\n\n\nI have spent my life working to make space for those who know what it is to be an outsider. As a therapist, I value your way of seeing the world and yourself, and I see our work together as very collaborative. My history in activism, the arts and mindfulness informs my approach to psychotherapy. I believe that who we are is influenced not just by our interpersonal relationships but also by our social and political environments, and the standards against which everyone is measured. Part of our work will be allowing you a space outside of those standards to explore your authentic self.\n\n\n\n\n\nI work with adults and children, and have worked extensively in the poly, LGBTQIQ, kinky communities."

I believe passionately in the right to sexual expression for <i>every body</i> and specialize in pelvic pain and education and advocacy with people with disabilities and illness.\n\n\n\n\n\nSexuality is a complex identity including relational, physiological, and emotional elements, but it is rooted in the lived experience of the body.  I am particularly passionate about providing support when our bodies change.  Perhaps things \"just don't work the same way\" after surgery, injury, medical treatment, or the onset of chronic illness.  Or perhaps sexual response and pleasure sensations are reduced after childbirth. Sexological Bodywork creates a safe container in which these concerns can be safely explored, understood, and transformed.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe nothing has changed, per say...you just know there has to be more to your sexuality.  You desire to connect deeply with your own desire, to REALLY know what you want, and to be able to express that to your partner(s).  Together we can increase your capacity to experience and savor pleasure and develop the confidence and communication skills you need to bring your new-found pleasures into your intimate relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy practice is trauma informed, and I am deeply committed to the primacy of emotional expression in the healing and learning processes.  All of you is welcome in our sessions!  But I never lose sight of the fact that your sexual yearnings and needs are rooted in and reaching for JOY.  With \"reverent irreverence\" and a profound sense of play, I am honored to support your journey to manifest your fullest vision of your erotic self.\n\n\n\n\n \nPoly, queer, kink, and sex-worker friendly.

            As a dating/relationship coach and certified clinical hypnotherapist, I specialize in helping people overcome the blocks that keep them from attracting the kind of love and intimacy they really want.

I have additional training in Generative Change Work, which helps people make change in their lives by tapping into inner resources and creativity, and Dynamic Attachment Repatterning, which helps people develop stronger and more secure attachment styles for easier and more joyful relationships.

            The most unique thing about me is that I am not a passive, "sounding board" therapist. I get right to work helping you figure out what you want to improve. What feelings/thoughts/behaviors do you want to change? What are the obstacles that have kept you from being able to make these changes before now? Then, we do active work, both in session, and in homework assignments. My approach is scientifically based and I provide a supportive, environment for clients in alternative sexual/relationship communities such as the LGBTQQAI+, polyamorous, kink, BDSM, swinger and sex-worker communities.





            I specialize in treating PTSD, trauma, complex trauma, anxiety, depression and self-esteem issues, boundaries and relationship communication.

            I help adults from the straight and LGBTQ communities and from the poly, kink, cisgender, trans, genderqueer and nonbinary communities with concerns including challenges in their relationships and poly relationship structures, feeling stressed and anxious, feeling badly about themselves, loneliness, challenges with being LGBTQ, sexuality, sexual orientation and gender (including transition), and challenges with alternative sexualities. My work is confidential and collaborative, and my office is a safe space to explore your concerns and how we can work through them together. I address all aspects of my clients' lives including friendships, family, culture and spirituality. My approach to psychotherapy is cognitive behavioural, narrative, relational, solution-focused, strengths-based and anti-oppressive.





            I have a Master's Degree in Counselling Psychology from the University of Toronto, a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Psychology from the University of British Columbia, and an Advanced Certificate in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy from The Hincks-Dellcrest Centre / University of Toronto. My work is inclusive and informed by anti-oppression training. I am a Founding Member of the Canadian Association of Cognitive Behavioural Therapies, a longstanding member of the LGBTQ community in Toronto and a Member of the Canadian Professional Association for Transgender Health. I am a kink-aware therapist.

            Inside all of us is a deep longing to live a rich, full, meaningful life. Yet sometimes it feels like something is in the way. Fear. Anxiety. Pain.  That's where therapy comes in.  I am passionate about helping people overcome their fears and live full and values-driven lives. My approach is collaborative, holistic, and always based on cutting-edge psychological research. I provide time-efficient, evidence-based, individualized services, to help you make sustainable changes in your daily routines, your relationship patterns, and your mindset. Some of the approaches I draw from include ACT, CBT, mindfulness, DBT, and exposure therapy. As I am also a certified yoga instructor, I can incorporate gentle movement if requested.





            I offer a safe space for exploring issues around sexuality, intimacy, and belonging. I am LGBTQ, Kink, and Poly educated, aware, and friendly. Holding non-judgmental and compassionate space for others is paramount to me in my practice and in my life. All are welcome in my office: every background, worldview, sexual and gender orientation.





            I see adults, currently only in individual format. While the focus is on you, we may discuss your partners, metamours, comets, etc. in the context of your growth in treatment, and I can make referrals as needed for adjunct partner/family therapy work, if desired.





            The initial phone consultation, where we discuss your needs and determine if I am a good fit for you, is complementary. My rate for a standard 50 minute session is $185. Extended 80 minute sessions are also available for an additional fee. See my website for full descriptions of services and rates. I do not accept insurance or sliding scale at this time, though you may request an invoice to submit as an out of network service to your insurance company.

            Is life feeling overwhelming? Do you feel stuck in old patterns, out of control or just freak'n frustrated? Okay, so here is some good news: getting started is one of the hardest parts of change, you are already on the road to change by seeking help. My job is to help you have a great life. It's a big goal, but the challenge and process are deeply gratifying in their own right. Therapy with me rests on two core principles: a gentle, warm, collaborative therapeutic relationship and a scientifically based approach which supports you in achieving your goals.





            My client's are creatives, entrepreneurs and change makers (or those that want to be). As a Registered Psychotherapist, Trauma Informed Therapist and Mindfulness Meditation Facilitator I create a safe space where creative people of all genders and sexual orientations can explore and find new awareness that will fuel change in their life.





            I'm a sex and kink positive; LGBTTQQIAAP affirmative, poly and non-monogamous relationship friendly therapist. If you are tired of feeling stuck with your status quo, or you want to bring even more goodness into your life, I invite you to give me a call at 647-992-2253 or email me from www.shaunacake.com.

            I believe that healing can be accomplished by using a combination of expressive arts, writing and traditional talk therapy. I specialize in working with survivors of trauma, HIV positive clients, those dealing with depression and anxiety and those participating in sex work; I run a very sex positive practice where all are welcome. I have sessions available on evenings and weekends, to accommodate work schedules and allow counseling to be a priority that you can keep.





            I am basic trained in Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), which is one of the leading techniques for dealing with past trauma. I believe that through play, education and communication, anyone can work through past traumas to make their future better. I look forward to working with you.

I am an experienced, open and creative therapist who enjoys meeting individuals where they are at, helping them discover where they have areas for growth, and helping set goals that will create more fulfillment in their lives. A mental health therapist since 2005 working with youth, families and individuals in a variety of domains, I am a primarily cognitive behavioral therapist with a strong creative bent, helping people identify and challenge unhelpful patterns of behavior or thinking that are creating problems in their life, and encouraging people to tap into their existing strengths to foster permanent healthy change. I am also trained in dialectical behavioral therapy, art therapy, and trauma-informed practices. I believe that there are many right ways to live our lives. It is up to each individual to discover the ways that they are living consistent with their own values, and to challenge the ways that they are not. I strongly believe that resiliency can be learned, that each person has the potential to create some peace and joy in their world. I have extensive experience in supporting youth ages 5-18, including culturally/ethnically diverse individuals, recent immigrants, and transgender, gender non-conforming, and/or gender fluid youth. I am also knowledgeable in supporting polyamorous, kinky, and queer individuals.  Alternate website: http://www.transmissionwellness.com/mollie-wirtz-lmhc'

            Do you feel stuck in your relationships or your sex life? What would it be like to get unstuck? If you could have the relationships that you deeply desire, what would they look like?





            As a sexuality & relationship coach, my goal is to help you create the relationships and sexual experiences that bring you joy, whatever that looks like for you. Part of that exploration means integrating the body, the heart, and the mind so that your choices are in alignment with every aspect of your self. Part of it means unpacking the old stories and looking for new perspectives that can guide you where you want to go. And part of it is finding the words that can make it easier to create the relationships that you're looking for. Whatever your goals and whatever brings you connection, joy, and love, I'll bring almost 30 years of experience talking about and exploring sexuality, a deep commitment to supporting your journey, and a celebration of your success.





            Some of my areas of expertise include: sex & shame, sex-positivity, queer issues, masculinity & gender, communities of erotic affiliation, and many sexual & relationship practices. I'm certified as a sexological bodyworker, a Somatica (R) practitioner, and a Trauma Release Exercises (R) provider, and I work with people of all genders, sexual orientations, and relationship styles. I'd love to welcome you in my Seattle, WA office (in the Central District) or work with you over video. (Skype, FaceTime, Zoom, etc.)





            Discounted rates are available for sexuality professionals. (sex educators, coaches, sex workers, therapists, writers, etc.)

I have since expanded my practice to include relationship coaching and sex-positive therapy for individuals, couples, and constellations* of people engaged in a wide range of relationship formations.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy professional aim is to offer accessible, wholistic, non-judgmental services to people from diverse backgrounds and identities. My work is informed by anti-oppression, anti-racist, feminist, and harm-reduction philosophies. I aim to co-create respectful, safer spaces where peoples' identities are understood within the framework of their own life experiences and social context.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy approach varies depending on the unique relationships and needs of the person/people who collaborate with me. I tend to begin with a relational/talk-based style and incorporate alternative techniques when applicable.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best way to get a feel for my style is to call or message me for a free consultation: connect@marlaschreiber.com (514) 714-3675\n\n\n\n\n\nWe might be a good fit if you're looking for support in the areas of:\n\n\n-         Relationships\n\n\n-         Polyamory\n\n\n-         Consensual non-monogamy\n\n\n-         Sexuality\n\n\n-         Intimacy\n\n\n-         Identity\n\n\n-         Kink/BDSM\n\n\n-         Gender\n\n\n-         \"Coming out\"*\n\n\n-         Communication\n\n\n-         Life transitions\n\n\n-         Spirituality\n\n\n-         Anxiety\n\n\n-         Addictions\n\n\n\n\n\n \nI am bilingual in English and French but have been working primarily in English for the last 5 years. I can offer French services for those who have minimal abilities in English so we can switch between languages in Montreal's FrEnglish fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n* Constellations refer to romantic and/or sexual relationship formations of more than 2 people.\n\n\n\n\n\n* \"Coming out\" is a term that is often used to describe the process of beginning to share one's sexual orientation with others. For those who are undergoing gender transformations, or people engaged in non-traditional relationship formations, \"coming out\" can be a similar process of sharing intimate parts of one's private life with others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Coming out\" is often mistaken for something that happens once but can actually be a very complicated process for some, taking place over a long period of time. Some might say that \"coming out\" happens regularly throughout the lifespan."

            As a therapist I believe that you have the power and knowledge within you to help with the problems you are experiencing; to heal and to grow. As a practitioner I make a commitment to you to help and support you with what you bring to me. To do this I use my experience and understanding to support you in a way which is open, non-judgmental, focused on your issues and as real and human as possible.





            I believe therapy is about your felt experience inside and outside of the therapy room, rather than about cognitive interpretations of your past and behaviour.





            Through effective therapy we can become more able to accept and respond flexibly to our feelings, relationships and circumstances.





            I work with a wide variety of people including LGBTQ+ individuals and their family members; people with or supporting people with disabilities and long term health conditions; people experiencing difficulties or abuse in their relationships





            As well as working with adults I am also experienced working with children and using play and art in therapeutic work.





            I offer sessions online (e.g. Skype, Zoom) as well as in person. As well as working in a typical counselling room I also offer sessions in natural spaces.

Of course, I am always learning from my personal life as well, where I have found a fulfilling and satisfying open relationship. This gives me added compassion and confidence to help clients create and navigate the relationships that they want. Since I take an adaptive client-centered approach, I have supported many couples in opening their relationships in a safe, connected and fulfilling way, as well as supporting people navigate Poly relationships. I serve a diverse client population, men, women and couples from early 20's to their 70's. Some common issues we see are mismatches in desire, low desire, recovering from trust issues, psychological erectile dysfunction, lack of confidence. Ultimately my role is twofold. First, to create a space where individuals better understand themselves and what motivates them in their sexual/emotional desires. Then I help them find an effective way to share this with their partners so that they can teach their partners how to love them.

            Searching for a welcoming environment where you don't have to explain your unique sexual expression? I'm polyamory/LGBTQIA/BDSM savvy, and am honored to provide a safe place for clients to heal their past and explore their future. Polyamory can trigger particular emotional challenges, which we can use as an opportunity to grow. My therapy style is warm, direct, compassionate, and collaborative, with a feminist lens. I foster your growth process by easing old patterns, relaxing shame, and helping new possibilities emerge. I am a certified EMDR practitioner, providing EMDR for 20 years. I specialize in freeing up clients from the effects of sexual violence.

I can help you explore the roots of your anxiety, depression, or PTSD symptoms and examine early childhood wounds. If you are struggling in your intimate relationship(s) with communication issues, reducing conflict, or other relational issues, I can help you and your partner(s) explore when those patterns started and where they come from, as well as to heal attachment injuries you may be experiencing. I offer a focus on holistic healing, communication tools, stress management techniques, and an exploration of those internal voices that seem to pull you one way and then the other. If you are interested in discussing yourself or your relationship(s) and collaborating to make your current or future relationship(s) better, I would love to help you meet those goals! I am familiar with hierarchical and non-hierarchical polyamory, solo polyamory, swinging, relationship anarchy, and more.

        description: |-
            Coming from the LGBTQ community, I have spent the last 30 years assisting clients from non-traditional families in the areas of estate planning, property, and family law.   I am a leader in the DC Metro area in Collaborative Practice, a non-litigation alternative to court based litigation which often includes judges and attorneys who are hostile to our non-traditional families.   A lot of my work over the years has been in the realm of helping non-traditional families create legal documents that support and strengthen the bonds between them, including through pre-nups, co-ownership, and parenting agreements.





            I generally charge at my hourly rate of $350 for services provided.   Because I have an obligation to my family as well as to my clients, I generally do not offer sliding scale rates, however, in a compelling case with reduced resources, I may consider a reduced rate.





            One point:  As a general rule, non-traditional families, especially those where there are children, should avoid litigation, because our family relationships are not recognized and may be used in a negative manner against us.   Having litigated in the past, I no longer do it because of the toll it takes on me and my clients.  However, if litigation is necessary, I will make a referral to my colleague, who is also from the LGBTQ community, and has a long record of working with non-traditional families.

Maybe you know that it's time to start therapy, but you're unsure about entering into a new vulnerable space. \n\n\n\n\n\nI value building safety and trust in therapy, so that you feel like you can truly be yourself, even if that self feels undefined or confusing at times. My role is to help you better understand yourself and support you in living a life that fits your hopes and values. \n\n\n\n\n\nI am a licensed clinical psychologist in Atwater Village, LA. I primarily see individual clients in their late teens through middle age. I don't take insurance, but I do my best to help you receive any reimbursement your insurance company provides for out-of-network mental health care. \n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to reach out to schedule a free phone consultation so we can talk a bit about what's bringing you to therapy, I can answer any questions you have, and we can go ahead and schedule a first appointment if we seem like a good fit."

            I am a Maryland-licensed massage therapist (LMT), certified practitioner of Integrative Reflexology(R), and Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT(R)200). My training includes over 100 hours of study and practice in trauma-informed care within and beyond the bodywork field. My previous work as an immigration legal assistant inspired a passion for working with survivors of gender-based and domestic violence to re-integrate touch as a safe, nurturing, and empowering experience. I am fluent in English (native) and Spanish.





            I employ a gentle, slow approach to bodywork therapy, which is recommendable for treating persons suffering from stress-related tension and chronic pain. Gentle bodywork practices, including yoga, massage, and other techniques, are becoming recognized as effective treatment options for PTSD and other stress-related pathologies. I operate with the highest standards of ethical behavior to create a safe space for people of all backgrounds and genders. Regarding accessibility, sliding scale fees, and trauma care, I have a strict no-questions-asked policy; though I hope you will find my practice a safe place to share any needs or concerns you might have.

In my practice I work with children, adolescents, and adults, and offer individual, family and couples therapy. I specialize in sexual health and well being and am passionate about the power of connection between mind, body and spirit. I work with individuals and couples on understanding themselves as sexual beings, whether this relates to their individual journey or within their relationships. I do this through helping you explore your sexual identity, expression and behaviors, as they relate to your goals. I value being present in the moment, having self-compassion and acceptance for oneself before working on relationships with others. I practice through a holistic lens and a mindful perspective, teaching clients some of the same techniques that I myself practice regularly to cope with the complex challenges life often brings. In my clinical practice, I hold the belief that my client is the expert of their own life and I am here to help you identify your own personal goals and support you on your journey to achieve them. Common issues I work with include: Pregnancy, postpartum, infertility, painful intercourse, orgasm concerns, performance issues, loss of interest/libido, premarital/marital couples counseling, sexual behavior experienced as problematic/compulsive, sexual trauma, body image, and the interplay of religion/spirituality and sex. Additionally, I specialize in anxiety, stress management, parent/child issues, and PTSD within multicultural communities.'

            Amy Stewart is a licensed Marital and Family Therapist and Certified Sex Therapist. Her style is open and direct and she maintains a progressive approach to her work, holding a strong interest in guiding non-traditional or ethically non-monogamous couples through relationship challenges. Ms. Stewart brings to her work a robustly feminist approach, believing that when women are better able to connect to their sexuality on their own terms, with regard to decision-making, choice and a focus on their own pleasure first, they will experience increased enjoyment of their sexuality and be better equipped to engage with their partners in high-quality sex. Sexual empowerment is a primary theme of her work and she believes this is a fundamental ingredient necessary for sexual pleasure.






            Ms. Stewart obtained her Bachelors Degree from Indiana University, studying both psychology and sociology, minoring in gender studies, while also holding a research position at the world-renowned Kinsey Institute. She went on to earn her Masters degree from The Family Institute at Northwestern University, obtaining specialized training in couples therapy. Ms. Stewart received her early training from Dr. Laura Berman, providing individual and sex therapy at the Berman Center, and maintained her own private practice for many years before joining the clinical team of Enliven Chicago and transitioning to Spark Chicago Therapy.

            I specialize in working with LGBTQIA couples and families.  I work with families and individuals of all ages.  I believe that families come in all shapes, sizes, and configurations and honor each client's right to define their own family structure.





            I specialize in concerns and distress around sexual orientation, sexual expression, and sexual desire.  I am a sex-positive therapist that is supportive of all forms of consensual sexual activity and a variety of alternative lifestyles.  I also have extensive knowledge about nonmonogamous lifestyles, am poly-friendly, and kink aware.  I will assist you in creating securely attached and intimate relationships, learning clear communication strategies, and developing healthy relationship agreements that meet your personal relationship needs.





            I specialize in addressing concerns and distress regarding gender identity.  I believe that gender expression is a spectrum and understand that many people do not fit into the binary understanding of gender.  I can assist families in understanding the developmental issues surrounding gender expression, assist parents in processing their own reactions to their child's gender expressions, and strive to promote family support, providing referrals and education about treatment options for people that present with gender dysphoria.  I also assist adults in exploring their own gender identity, promote authentic gender expression, and can support clients who desire to seek medical transition.

I specialize in anxiety and caring for people who are 'caregivers' in their relationships - either as parents, as partners, as paid or family caregivers, or even if you are just the sort of person who reflexively put others' needs ahead of your own.

But, commitment without eroticism leave us with the kind of relationship that is strong in commitment, security and comfort but weak in adventure, complicity and playfulness. Some are only interested in relationships that are enduring, but leave no room for ardent frivolity, some know and expect more. My practice, is aimed at creating relationships that are stable, secure, and at the same time meaningful, exciting and playful. I attempt this with a style that is validating and experiential. \n\n\n\n\n\nI am fully fluent in English and Spanish \n\n\n\n\n\nI work with all populations except children under 13 years of age and anyone who is abusive to animals"

            My goal is to combat the stigmas impacting marginalized communities through access to mental health resources. These stigmas create barriers to treatment, contribute to a lack of culturally competent resources, infringe upon a person's bodily autonomy, and contribute to discriminatory incidents.

            Populations: I counsel all communities and specialize in non-monogamous relationships, individuals who have participated in the erotic trade industry, and the kink and queer communities.

            I am a poly- and kink-friendly therapist who provides affirmative therapy to clients in the Gender, Sexual, and Relational Diversity community. I work with adolescents (aged 12 and above), adults, families, couples, and other relationship constellations to improve relationships and facilitate personal growth.  As your therapist, I will strive to create a warm, collaborative relationship with you.  I am interested in your experience, open-minded, and sex-positive.  My goal is to create a meaningful therapeutic context in which each client feels safe, seen, and heard.  Whether your concerns relate to life transitions, depression, anxiety, relationships, external stressors, or personal growth, our work will be in a non-judgmental, caring environment. My therapeutic approach is grounded in the most current, culturally-aware, trauma-informed, and evidence-based practices, including Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT), Mindfulness, Narrative Therapy, and Motivational Interviewing.





            My own experiences of personal transition have shown me that life affords us many opportunities for growth and change - as individuals, and in our relationships with family members, partners, and friends. In my practice I focus on thinking and attachment patterns, and on the many personal, social, and cultural factors that contribute to resilience.  Whatever your goals for therapy, I'm here to help.





            Please note:  Since I'm active in the local community and attend local events, it's possible that we may know some of the same people, and this is something we should discuss at the outset.  If it's a concern, I'll provide you with appropriate referrals.

            It is clear to me that people's suffering and challenges are not failures of their bodies or minds, but are responses to a culture that has damaging views on sexuality, relationships, bodies, race, and gender. What can be understood can be changed and something better take its place.





            Through mind/body approaches and information from the leading researchers on sexuality and relationships, I help you to get back in touch with yourself and others, communicate more effectively, assist you to shed shame and misconceptions, and create sexy sustainable relationships. I specialize in supporting people within the Ethical Non-monogamy, LGBTQ+, Kink/BDSM, or Sex Worker communities, People of Color and those in interracial relationships.

            In my practice, I focus on building insight, compassion, and acceptance of oneself and others, while challenging the dynamics and structures that pose obstacles to successful growth and healing. I strive to uphold principles and practices of cultural awareness and sensitivity, and to regard each client as the expert on their own experience. Through this framework, I am well-equipped to treat issues related to marginalized populations and non-traditional communities. In addition to my experience and skill in addressing commonly-occurring mental health concerns like depression and anxiety, I have special interest in working with body diversity through a Health at Every Size model, LGBTQIA+ communities, polyamory and ethical non-monogomy, kink/BDSM communities, and other people who may feel like "misfits" or in some way live outside the expectations of mainstream society.

        description: "I draw on personal and professional experience in working therapeutically with diverse sexualities, including: individuals that may identify as LGBTQIA, poly/ ethically non-monogamous. I have completed training with Pink Therapy on working with Gender, Sexuality and Relationship Diversity (GSRD) as a GSRD identified clinician. The main approach that I work with is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, a practical approach which focuses on changing problematic thinking styles and behaviour patterns through the use of solutions, tools and techniques. If you are hoping to make changes fairly quickly and acquire direct solutions to your difficulties then CBT is a great option: most clients notice a change within six sessions and are able to see significant improvements within 10-12 sessions. My previous experience includes working for the NHS alongside private practice. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am experienced in treating various presentations including: Depression, Generalised Anxiety Disorder, Health Anxiety, Phobias, OCD, Social Anxiety, Body Dysmorphia, Perfectionism, Low self- esteem, PTSD, Trauma, Relationship difficulties and also Long-Term Physical Health Conditions. I utilise a transdiagnostic approach, integrating CBT models and formulations with processes that occur across disorders. This for example includes working with processes such as and Rumination and Intolerance of Uncertainty as well as painful emotions such as Shame and Guilt. Further to this, I have found it effective to incorporate third wave approaches such as Compassion Focused Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Mindfulness and Distress Tolerance Skills into my clinical work. Central within my practice is the belief that effective therapy is flexible and able to address the unique difficulties that individuals present. I am interested in how dominant discourses can shape people's lives in destructive ways. This includes, experiences of oppression, shame and identity. In the context of therapy this can mean exploring stories of the self, helping individuals externalise their difficulties and co-authoring new narratives.  \n\n\n\n\n\nI am based in South and Central Cambridge and am also able to offer sessions and via the telephone."

I work with adults and older adolescents who present with a wide variety of concerns such as relationship challenges, life transitions, self-esteem, women's issues, perfectionism, stress management, anxiety, and depression. I specialize in working with trauma survivors, LGBTQ+ folks, individuals looking to explore cultural/identity issues, college/graduate students, and individuals in polyamorous/consensually non-monogamous/kink/BDSM relationships. \n\n\n\n\n\nI am a sex-positive clinician who is aware and affirming of sexual diversity, including polyamory, consensual non-monogamy (CNM), kink, BDSM, altsex communities and other sexual identities. I recognize that sexual diversity is more than sexual orientation. It includes our sexual and relationship structure, orientation, preferences and practices. All people deserve to meet with a therapist who understands and affirms their relationship identity and sexual practices without unnecessarily making that a focus of treatment. My practice is a safe and inclusive space for all identities.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an LGBTQ therapist, I am committed to providing a safe and affirming space for diverse sexual and gender identities. If you are struggling with feelings or experiences of shame, confusion, anxiety, depression, rejection, discrimination, or bullying due to your sexual or gender identity, therapy can offer a healing space to process these negative experiences and improve your sense of belonging, self-acceptance, and self-worth as well as your relationships with others. Therapy can also be a useful space to deepen our relationship with ourselves and learn what it means to love ourselves radically.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am an out-of-network provider, which means I do not accept payment directly from insurance companies. However, most insurance plans offer part or full coverage for out-of-network mental health services. Please contact me to discuss my services and fees further."

            I have been licensed as a Psychologist (PhD-Doctor) since 2001. I received my Master's Degree in Psychology in December of 1988 and thus have +30 years of experience as a psychotherapist.  This year (2018), I published my first Audio-Book, "Meditative Visualization; How 2 Minutes a Day Can Change Your Life," available via Amazon.com, iTunes.com, CDBaby.com and more. I began meditating in 1998 & teaching Meditation +/-2004. My clients have asked me for years to publish my techniques on stress management, creating dynamically balanced lifestyles, problem-solving, goal setting, & creating internal resilience in our ever-changing world. In addition, I have been training as a Shaman (Sha-Woman) since 2013 and have subtly integrated that in to my psychotherapy practices.





            I offer individual & couples therapy for adults dealing with anxiety, depression & major life transition issues. I also have experience addressing polyamorous & alternative relationship (mutually consensual non-monogamous) issues & experience in helping people manage the emotional components of auto-immune issues (Chronic Fatigue).

            I am a Somatica Practitioner working with individuals and couples to support the creation of their own flavor, or style, of relationships. I help my clients discover and soften growth-edges enabling increased desire and sensual celebration to emerge. Empowering woman's and men's unique erotic embodiment and expression fuels my work. I am especially happy about working with clients of any gender and sexual orientation. Passionate about cultivating resilience around growth-oriented mentality via authentic connection, I am thrilled to be working with the Santa Cruz community in person as well as the broader community via virtual sessions.





            I have been studying with The Somatica Institute since 2017 and hold a BS in Biology and Environmental Science from CSUMB. Professional work, experiences and other trainings I draw my passions from include tantra, regenerative agriculture, herbalism, horse training, dance therapy, and communal living.  It is imbedded into my coaching modality to have no judgement around all types of relationship orientations. One of my specialities  is around non-monogamy since that is my personal orientation. I speak English. My clients are adults, over 18, and we work together with a wide variety of relationship challenges from platonic to sexual. This is not 'sex work' and I do work with my clients from a foundation of sexual positivity. You can learn more about the Somatica Method at https://www.somaticainstitute.com/somatica-philosophy/

            I provide a relaxed, open, collaborative and non-judgmental atmosphere. When working with patients, I will cater my approach to your needs, but my natural style is goal-oriented, so I tend to delve into the issues at hand so that you can see improvement in your emotional well-being as quickly as possible. Society tends to define a romantic relationship as a one on one arrangement, but the truth is, that is not always the case.







            Whether your relationship involves two or more people, or whether you have (or are considering) an open relationship, working with a polyamory-aware counselor can help you to define your boundaries as a couple, create agreements for a healthy relationship, cope with jealousy, and explore sexual and romantic relationships that fall outside of traditional concepts of monogamous arrangements. If you are beginning to explore your identity or orientation as polyamorous as an individual, it is advisable to work with a counselor who affirms and recognizes this as such.







            I understand that a loving relationship can take many forms, and my aim when working with clients is at affirming healthy, ethical, consensual non-monogamous relationships.

            My goal as a therapist is to partner with clients to build on their strengths and deepen their perspective into the transitions and challenges they face. I have extensive experience working within queer and poly communities, as well as with those who have lived through trauma. While my practice is rooted in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), I use a variety of techniques tailored to your needs. I am committed to using an anti-oppressive framework that explores how environments, relationships, and circumstances shape your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. I offer individual therapy and couples therapy to adults who are 18 and older. While each of my clients brings a unique set of experiences and challenges to therapy, some common areas of therapeutic focus include:





            * Stress





            * Anxiety





            * Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)





            * Depression





            * Trauma





            * Grief and loss





            * Gender identity





            * Sexuality





            * Polyamory / open relationships





            * Life transitions





            * School





            * Career





            * Family and relationship conflict

            Surrogate partner therapy is a somatic form of therapy designed to increase a client's capacity for emotional and physical intimacy. It was developed by Masters and Johnson in the 1970s and uses evidence-based research to overcome challenges related to intimacy, touch, and sexuality.   The client forms a therapeutic relationship with the surrogate partner to develop the skills to form a relationship with a partner out in the real world. The therapy proceeds at a pace friendly to each client's needs. This experiential learning is divided into phases designed to build self-awareness and resolve deeply-ingrained issues surrounding relationships, intimacy, and sexuality.   Emily works with a supervising licensed therapist and accepts clients of all genders, sexual orientations, and relationship modalities.

            Somatic Experiencing Practitioner.  Consultation and healing arts centered on embodied mindfulness and research in stress & trauma physiology, solidly rooted in social work values, including awareness of the interplay of environment and relationships on patterns of functioning. Over 75 hours of sex therapy clinical training, including Sensate Focus and partner-based activities.   I am a licensed social worker but not a clinical social worker, meaning I am not licensed to diagnosis or treat mental illness.  I approach trauma from an integrative, relational, and strength-based perspective, not a medical model, and individual session work is just one part of my practice that predominately focuses on research and work that brings communities and organizations into regulation, safety, and health.






            Age 18 and older. Specializing in resolving trauma in the body, through touch-based or talk-based modalities, or both.  Touch-based work can be done in person or taught over video with a friend or partner, talk-based modalities by video only. Work with groups, such as organization leadership is contract-based.

            As a queer and polyamorous identified woman, I aim to serve my community. I focus on serving sexual minority communities, including LGBTQ, nonmonogamous/polyamorous, and kinky folx, and sex workers; and survivors of sexual and relational trauma. At Quest Center, I can see folx 18+ who are on Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid) or have private insurance for individual therapy. In my private practice, I focus on sex therapy issues with individuals and couples. Please see my website for rates and insurances accepted. Most of my clients are struggling with symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and trauma. I utilize narrative therapy, feminist therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, parts work, and family systems approaches to help clients find new ways of thinking about themselves and challenges they face in their lives.

Coaching also provides accountability for the student, which can be critical.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the child is underage, parents may be included in some sessions; if the child is an adult, I provide a waiver form that allows me to discuss certain issues with the parents if necessary. \n\n\n\n\n\nSessions are held using Zoom video chat, so distance is not a limitation on service."

Everyone has their own unique story, and my goal is to help each client become the director of their own story by empowering them to take charge of their life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI strive to create an atmosphere of warmth, safety, and curiosity in therapy.

This means I try to balance addressing present-day challenges with identifying and healing the roots of those challenges, which often involve our formative experiences and relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel it is important to consider and explore our internal experience of ourselves and others, as well as identify how our thoughts, feelings, and close relationships might interact in our lives and minds to create both difficulties and opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\nAppreciation of each person's unique cultural context is very important to me, and I have experience working with people of many diverse gender identities, sexual orientations, relationship practices, racial/ethnic backgrounds, abilities, and spiritual beliefs. \n\n\n\n\n\nI provide psychotherapy to residents of California either in-person (post-pandemic) in Pasadena or online via video therapy.

        description: "I work with poly individuals and couples, or throuples, from both straight and queer-identified communities. I prioritize poly clients in my practice because it can be difficult to connect to a poly-positive therapist, even in a big city like Toronto. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy work is informed by anti-oppression training and guided by adult-attachment theory. I practice Emotionally Focused Therapy with couples and throuples; by building stronger connections between them, issues and concerns are often resolved. \n\n\n\n\n\nWith individuals, my work remains relational. I draw from a variety of modalities to help folks identify and communicate their needs, determine their boundaries and provide insight into the dynamics of their relationships."

            I trained at ProcessworkUK, and have 10 years experience of seeing clients. I work with individuals, couples, thruples and polycules as well as groups. My practice is sex positive, trauma informed and works with the body, the mind and the heart. I'm also sex critical-  sex can be wonderful or horrible, however it is not the be all and end all. As a process-oriented practitioner I tailor sessions to you and what is happening- it may be more linear and involve talking and coaching or we will explore your dreams or work with your body. I'm deeply passionate about working with people and cherish the beautiful diversity of both humans and nature ore briadly. I'm not just interested in"fixing" things but also in engaging with the creativity of the challenges you face. I'm a cis queer white woman, aware of the privilege and challenges that this brings to my perspective. Im a mother of a mixed race child and am engaged around issues of racism, white privilege and parenting. I run a group for mothers local and am setting up a monthly sex conversations group in Stroud. I also work in corporate settings where I deliver very practice-oriented conflict facilitation and leadership trainings.

        description: "As a systemically trained therapist, I view my clients within the context of the systems around them, which include their relationships (or lack thereof), and as a collaborative therapist, I keep an open dialogue in the session both about the issues that clients bring in and about the process of therapy itself.

I also specialize in working with LGBTQIA+ folkx, and I am a professional member of WPATH. Although your reasons for therapy may not have anything to do with your sexuality, gender identity, or relationship status, you can work with me and be open about who you are without the fear of being pathologized or judged. You can check out my website or PsychologyToday page for my areas of speciality, or contact me directly to discuss if I would be a good fit for your needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nI also offer teletherapy (online video therapy) to clients located within Texas.

I work with individuals and couples. I support non judgmental exploration and discussion of conflicts they may face, in terms of family, religious upbringing and internal struggles. I encourage a sex positive environment and I am kink allied. My background is in substance misuse counseling. I also see a large proportion of clients struggling with body image concerns and disordered eating. I work in a relational way, that invites the client into the therapeutic process, setting goals, assigning homework if appropriate, coming up with ways to better resource in times of stress/  emotional overwhelm. I enjoy working with people who view themselves as sensitive beings, intuitives /empaths. I am somatically trained, which means I invite the body into the therapy, offering interventions such as grounding exercises/ mindfulness, aromatherapy and other somatic resourcing techniques.

            Hello! I'm a highly trained and experienced psychotherapist, with a personal history in the kink/poly communities.  I understand the difficulty that we have when seeking counseling,  from folks who may not quite fathom the nature of our identities and choices, or who may have some judgments around that. I do great work with both individuals and couples; and am also very attuned with how various addictions and compulsions enter our sphere. I'm a solution-focused therapist, and will work diligently with you to build the life you seek.

            Therapy allows us to use our therapeutic relationship to create opportunities for repair and provides a safe, non-judgmental environment to heal inner pain. I work with individuals to create treatment goals that are tailored to their unique needs and history. Together we will create lasting changes that lead to a more fulfilling life.





            My approach is eclectic and holistic - one that incorporates psychodynamic, relational & trauma-informed lenses for treatment. I am also a certified Yoga Teacher. I often use mindfulness techniques, CBT, addiction models, and body oriented therapies in sessions. I am passionate about LGBTQIA affirming, body positive, poly-friendly, sex positive therapy.





            Together we will identify the therapeutic tools that are the best fit for you. I look forward to sharing in your journey toward healing. Starting the therapeutic journey can be difficult at first and I welcome you to reach out for a free initial consultation.

            In the Happiness Lab, we craft your own personal brand of Happiness. I have a dynamic background with treatment modalities such as CBT, DBT, Mindfulness, Somatics, and Harm Reduction.  I am a strong believer in building skills to increase enjoyment in life and to manage symptoms that get in the way of doing so.  I am available to work with people on teletherapy platforms, in an office and other settings.





            Though I no longer speak French nor Japanese fluently, I have lived in France and Japan and have a lived cultural understanding of each.  I work with adults with mild to moderate mental health issues, couples and families of both traditional and non-traditional structures and styles.

        description: Marie came from a toxic evangelical Christian background which was very challenging to deconstruct in her teens and early 20s. The years since that deconstruction have consisted of healing and reframing her worldview absent indoctrination from a toxic form of religion. Part of that reframing involved questioning the monogamy narrative that is deeply embedded in our culture. She ventured into non-monogamy as part of her healing path and gained so much. Releasing the messages of purity culture. Finding her voice in sexual situations. Knowing her worth in her relationships. Learning how to assert her needs and be responsible for her own feelings. She now provides coaching to others who are a) seeking to deconstruct the codependent monogamous narrative (yet stay monogamous), b) those curious about non-monogamy and want to talk it through, c) those already involved in non-monogamy who are facing challenges and need help working through things and problem-solving. Marie has gained expertise and respect for her knowledge in ENM through her podcast Everyone's Agnostic, her appearances on other such platforms, like Dr. Darrel Ray's Secular Sexuality, and through her coaching services. Marie is fluent in both English and Spanish. She specializes in helping those approaching ENM with a traumatic background in toxic religion. She can provide coaching in person, via chat, via email, or via video-conferencing.

        description: I own an LGBTQ and poly-friendly private group practice for holistic marriage and family therapy with a specialization on preschoolers, children, teens, and young adults.  I am open 7 days a week and have late evening appointments. On a side note, I am also a 500 hour registered yoga therapist, so I enjoy offering mediation, breathing, yoga poses, and holistic techniques into my practice for PTSD/trauma healing. I offer an out-of-the-box approach using creative art, yoga, music, animals, and outdoor walking therapies for wellness and coping skills. I also offer phone and distance video sessions to residents of CT or international residents. I am considered an out-of-network provider. What that means is that payment in full is due at the time of your session and then you may seek potential reimbursement from your insurance. I've had clients that receive 100% reimbursement and some that have no benefits. You can also use a HSA or FSA card for services. I am happy to walk you through this process.

            Description of Services:





            The world-wide expert on polyamorous families with children, Dr. Sheff provides expert witness services, writing and academic consulting, and relationship coaching. An expert in families of sex and gender minorities, Sheff can conduct interviews, review documents or reports, and provide assessments that distinguish between families that are merely unconventional and those that are truly problematic. Sheff can advise lawyers, prepare statements and court briefs, and provide testimony. In courtroom testimony, Sheff uses empirical data from her own and others' research to counter misinformation, prejudice, and fear about sex and gender minorities.





            Using her extensive knowledge of polyamory and kink/BDSM, Sheff provides one-time relationship consultations for those who wonder how polyamory or kink might impact their lives and ongoing coaching for those who are seeking an external perspective and strategies to deal with jealousy, set realistic boundaries, deal with conflict, and improve communication skills. Dr. Sheff can meet with you in person when possible, via telephone, or Skype.





            From universities to MeetUps and Cons, Dr. Sheff speaks to groups and organizations about sex and gender diversity, and how it relates to families, health, and laws. Sheff has provided keynote addresses at InfinityCon and Atlanta Poly Weekend, and presented at conferences from the American Psychiatric Association to the National Council on Family Relations as well as conventions like DragonCon and Frolicon.





            Author of three books, over 20 peer-reviewed publications, and hundreds of blogs on her own site and Psychology Today, Sheff provides writing services and uses her range of writing skills to help you create content for your website, write your book, or turn your masters thesis into a journal article.

        description: I regularly help people with trauma, anxiety, attachment and relationship issues. I primarily work with adults. My regular non-insurance rate is presently $100 for sessions that run up to an hour. It is possible that your insurance company will not pay for couples counseling or more informal couples coaching, so if you are interested in working with me, and want to know about the insurance coverage, you will need to call your insurance carrier directly to ask about that and let me know of any information need from me to explore that. We can have a no-cost preliminary chat about both your therapeutic needs and financial matters before proceeding to ensure there are no surprises. I recognize that going to a therapist is usually no easy or small thing, and am happy to reduce the stress involved in that.

            I am familiar with the variety of consensual non-monogamy, from swinging to polyamory, and I approach all of my work through an intersectional feminist lens, with acknowledgment of the importance of power imbalances in relationships.

            My focus in my practice is to serve those individuals, couples, and families who live outside the confines of dominant society's expectations. I offer affirmative therapy for LGBTQIA+/kink/CNM/polyam/etc persons, using a largely solution-focused approach. My goal is for you to have the inclusive support you deserve to improve your life the way you want.

            In addition to in-office sessions in Rochester, MN, I can provide teletherapy elsewhere in MN using approved insurances listed on my inclusivetherapists.com profile.

        description: "My practice focuses on criminal, civil and family law litigation with over 20 years of tested experience throughout southeastern Pennsylvania and Maryland.  My passion is assisting individuals and small businesses with their varied legal issues.  I have successfully tried civil and criminal jury trials, contested family law hearings, administrative proceedings and appeals.\n\n\n\n\n\nI also serve as an arbitrator in civil court cases, and have been court-appointed as defense counsel in state criminal prosecutions. In addition to my solo law practice, I additionally serve as a Special Assistant Public Defender in Magisterial District Courts throughout Montgomery County. I'm a contributing author (and have even been editor-in-chief) to the Montgomery Bar Association's Civil Practice Manual, the definitive legal manual for practicing law in Montgomery County. \n\n\n\n\n\nMany moons ago, I earned an Ivy League degree in philosophy from Columbia University, and then my law degree from the University of Miami.  I began my legal career as a judicial law clerk in Towson, Maryland, and first established my own law practice there at the age of 26. I moved to Pennsylvania in 2000, and revived my solo practice after working for a few years with local law firms. These early efforts were rewarded by being named a \"Pennsylvania Super Lawyer - Rising Star\" in 2005 and 2006 by the publishers of Philadelphia magazine. \n\n\n\n\n\nBased upon my law firm experiences, I have found that I now best serve my clients one-on-one as a solo attorney.  Currently, I am privileged to be a trusted advisor and knight-in-shining-armor to satisfied clients throughout the country. I pride myself on providing personalized and affordable legal services to my clients . . . and I even return phone calls."

        description: "I am a Clinical Social Worker, licensed in the state of California (#86545). My practice currently includes individual and relationship therapy for adults. I believe that the mind and body are complementary parts of the self, and that our wellness is impacted by our social, cultural, and physical environments. I work to help identify and deconstruct systems of oppression and the impact these systems have on our mental health and wellness. I integrate this into the therapeutic process which I believe can be critical for healing. I also incorporate trauma-informed, harm reduction, insight-oriented, relational and mindfulness approaches into my practice, as well as the integration of non-ordinary states of consciousness. I have expertise in queer identities and relationships, and have worked extensively with LGBTQIA+ populations and communities of color, both of which I identify with.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome areas of focus within my practice include:\n\n\n- LGBTQIA+ populations and communities of color\n\n\n- Sexuality and gender identity\n\n\n- Non-monogamous, open, polyamorous, alternative relationships\n\n\n- Depression\n\n\n- Anxiety\n\n\n- Trauma processing - abuse, domestic violence, historical/ intergenerational trauma, sexual trauma, community violence, etc. \n\n\n- Substance misuse (harm reduction approach)\n\n\n- Grief and loss\n\n\n- Integration of non-ordinary states of consciousness"

        description: My passion in being a psychotherapist is the honor of being present on people's journey's to learning how to live fearlessly. I enjoy using CBT/DBT and trauma informed care as well as other eclectic and creative ways to identify challenges and create goals that work for each person so they can feel authentic in their day to day. Typically addressing anxieties and large life transitions, we take a look at the patterns to the how and why we are the way we are and then reframe them in a way that builds on strengths. I highly enjoy working with those who identify on the LGBTQ spectrum as well as those with HIV health challenges. A really unique piece of my practice includes occasionally meeting in the community park for walking sessions. I offer Individual and family counseling and accept some Blue Shield of CA and some Aetna plans as well as private pay (can provide a superbill if needed).

        description: I like providing services to people who engage in open relationship models because I enjoy people who think outside the box. I have a trauma informed approach, using a blend of mindfulness, brain science education, and parts work, coupled with a large dose of personal presence to guide my clients through anxiety, stress, life transitions and more. I have taken Level 1 and Level 2 of the Gottman courses, and completed a Level 1 training in Internal Family Systems (IFS). In my sessions, it's "two people thinking well about one person" and that person is my client. I offer a free phone consultation to make sure we are a good fit and am on a number of insurance panels. Out of pocket my fee is $200, with a few spots for sliding scale clients. I generally see individuals, but I sometimes have openings for couples. I am sex positive, kink friendly and have experience with gender non-binary presentations. For more in depth information check out my website at www.kasejawilder.com

        description: For me, therapy is about listening, not just responding. I want clients to feel safe, secure, and feel validated. My style is person centered, solution focused, and highly collaborative. I tend to use a psychodynamic, strengths-based approach that enhances skills you already use, mixed with a variety of evidence-based therapeutic techniques, including CBT, DBT, family of origin, and feminist therapy. Rather than just one technique, I tailor my sessions your need. I regularly train and keep current on best practices to ensure I am competent on evidence based techniques as it relates to LGBTQ community and relationship diverse communities.

               - affirmations of divorce


            * Celebrations of the end of life


               - memorials and funerals - and all the family complexity that entails


               - end of life vigils


            * Restorative Circles, a conflict resolution method which encourages deep and reflective listening in a circle of supportive community (Restorative Circles require thoughtful explanation - please contact me free of charge to learn more about them before you decide whether this is the right action for you).


            * Spiritual companionship: walking with you and asking directive questions as you sort out a new stage of spiritual understanding and development.





            Fees:  I ask for $160 per half-day of work and am open to barter.  A wedding is about one full day of interviews, writing, and performing the ceremony (spread out over many weeks, of course).  If I'm driving over sixty miles to work with you, I will add on the federal business mileage rate; I'm based in Plainfield, NH.





            Limitations: I am not yet well enough educated to serve the kink community; I hope that kink folks can find a good officiant for their needs elsewhere.

            I enjoy working with clients who are dealing with anxiety, depression, trauma, and life adjustments. My interests and passions are working with gender and sexual minorities (LGBTGEQ+), poly/CNM relationships, the kink community, survivors of sexual assault and relational abuse, the Gaming and Cosplay community, the Drag and Burlesque community, and working with teens and young adults.





            One of the benefits of being both a counselor and an art therapist is being able to tailor the treatment to you. We can work together using creative techniques and art therapy interventions or we can tackle your goals with more traditional therapy techniques. My therapy style is eclectic, which means that I incorporate different theories and interventions in sessions to create an individualized approach for each person. Come as you are and leave as you want to be.

        description: "I am a Registered Mental Health Counselor Intern practicing psychotherapy in an intimate private practice in Largo, FL. My practice operates under an anti-discrimination policy, so my clients can rest assured that they are safe and will be respected within this space.\n\nMy primary therapeutic focus is serving and supporting my transgender, genderqueer, non-binary, and gender diverse siblings. I proudly serve the entire LGBQIAP+ community, consensually non-monogamous adults, and those who practice BDSM/kink. My particular areas of interest include gender-affirming care, grief/loss, trauma, shame, anxiety, and depression.\n\nTogether, we will spend time defining, holding space for, and problem-solving whatever is keeping you stuck from being the most true and authentic version of you or from having more effective connections in your relationships.\n\nYou may wish to explore the facets of your identity including sexuality, gender, relationship structure, race, or sexual desires or the intersections of these pieces of your identity. I'm here for all of you - no topic is too taboo and nothing is off the table to be discussed in session. \n\n\n\n\n\nContact me today to see if we're a good fit!\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulations served: 16y/o+ (with supportive parents/guardians) for gender-affirming assessments and referral letters; 25y/o+ for individual and relational therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't take insurance as a registered intern, but if someone can't afford my full rates and would be using insurance I'm happy to discuss a negotiated rate. Sliding scale opportunities available based on need."

            I work primarily with LGBTQ+ and/or polyamorous/non-monogamous folks around many different struggles, not always with a focus on identity or sexuality. My style of practicing comes from a Narrative Therapy approach, which places the client as the expert and the problem as the problem.

            I'm a money coach and I help people from all life situations move from money anxiety to financial empowerment. I have a specific focus on those in the consensual non-monogamy community, or those in any nontraditional relationships and lifestyles.





            My work involves three areas:





            Practicality - Create a budget and action plan to get you unstuck. Map out specific goals for your future.





            Emotion - Move from feeling out of control and anxious to feeling confident, self-assured, and excited about the future.





            Identity - Learn how you have become who you are. Take control of your money story to become who you want to be.





            I can help you get unstuck and unlock your ability to build and maintain wealth. If you are tired of working hard and not getting where you want to go, let's get on a call.

We carry with us stories and patterns that have likely served us in the past, but may no longer serve us. This can exacerbate symptoms of anxiety, depression or other mental health symptoms. Exploring and recognizing, with gentleness, how these patterns have become detrimental, gives us the freedom to choose what themes we insert in our life, and what we no longer have space for.

I embrace diversity in all forms and place great importance on curating a nonjudgmental therapeutic space that is truly representative of New York City. I currently offer adults in-person and telehealth sessions in English. You can find me online at the address above or at http://nyctherapyandwellness.com/

            I am an English-speaking, sex-positive, LGBTQ-affirming, and kink-aware, licensed clinical and health psychologist in Colorado who specializes in polyamorous and other non-traditional relationships and lifestyles. I am currently accepting new adult clients for individual therapy and partners counseling. I offer a free 15-minute phone consultation to new clients to help determine if it would be a good fit for working together. I do home-based, phone and also HIPAA-compliant video conferencing sessions. I try to make therapy affordable to as many people as possible and thus offer a sliding fee scale as necessary to my clients. For many people, poly is more than a chosen relationship structure - it is an identity. As your therapist, I do not assume that your identity or relationship structure is the source of your concerns. While polyamory can provide satisfying relationships and rich opportunities for personal growth, it may also bring its own unique set of challenges. With personal and professional experience, I can help you navigate through arising concerns and topics such as:





            Deciding what form of polyamory is best for you





            Negotiating agreements and boundaries of relationships





            Approaching the "coming out" process





            Negotiating relationship parameters





            Jealousy management





            Improving communication





            Time management





            Cultural differences





            Infidelity and broken trust





            Power dynamics

            I work with adult individuals, couples/relationship members, and adult families. My approach is experiential, somatic and transpersonal.  My primary areas of focus are trauma and relationships, including kink, polyamory, and non-monogomy. I work with a broad range of issues. Call for a complimentary brief consultation.





            I warmly welcome you as you are, and hold a safe space to support your intention for growth and healing as your witness and companion. I offer experiential therapy, so you can move beyond cognitive understanding to actually having a transformative experience in session. I hold a body-based, integral, and spiritual frame for the work of therapy. (Somatic and transpersonal, to use psychology jargon.) This means that relief and healing can come from integrating mind with body and emotions, and expanding awareness. I have an active style that is much more than simply listening. I identify as a highly sensitive person (HSP) of gifted intelligence, both of which inform my work.

By working collaboratively you can leave the frustration, disappointment, pressure, anger, guilt, and hurt that you have experienced and move towards intimacy, connection, openness, honesty, trust, acceptance, love, and joy.\n\n\n\n\n\nTherapy can sometimes be difficult for busy professionals who are often on the go or those who simply don't feel comfortable visiting a therapist's office. Thanks to advancements in HIPPA approved online platforms, you can benefit from Dr. Jones' compassionate approach from anywhere, including the comfort of your very own home.

        description: I am a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and I studied Counseling Psychology at the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) with a specialization in Somatic Psychotherapy. Much of my seven years of therapeutic experience comes from my time serving marginalized communities in various Community Mental Health Settings. My current practice focuses on providing trauma-informed psychodynamic psychotherapy to adults and adolescents who identify (or think they may identify) with being part of the LGBT, Queer, Poly, Gender Non-Conforming and Kinky communities. I have a passion for social justice issues and exploring how systems of oppression impact marginalized communities. I use a harm reduction approach for those who use substances, and I'm also enthusiastic about creating a safe space to explore and integrate themes that may arise during the course of a psychedelic journey. My approach is eclectic and holistic for those who are facing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. I am also thrilled to be a member of the Health at Every Size (HAES) community, and I strive to provide competent care for all bodies.

            As a nonbinary trans person, I have lived experience and professional experience working with the LGBTQ community.  I am committed to providing an affirming space for folks practicing non-monogamy or polyamory.  I work with folks from all backgrounds, spiritual practices, genders, and sexual orientations.  My MA is from Naropa University's Contemplative program, and I have completed a Marriage and Family Therapy training program at Denver Family Institute.





            I offer individual and couples therapy for adults from a contemplative, systems-focused framework.  I have also been trained in Emotionally Focused Therapy for couples.  My specialties include working with poly folks, and gender identity development.  I also have an interest in supporting spiritual journeys and development with individuals.  I am currently accepting clients on Fridays and Saturdays, but looking to expand my office hours to the weekday.  So please reach out if you are interested in weekday availability as well.

            Somatic Experiencing Practitioner.  Consultation and healing arts centered on embodied mindfulness and research in stress & trauma physiology, solidly rooted in social work values, including awareness of the interplay of environment and relationships on patterns of functioning. Over 75 hours of sex therapy clinical training, including Sensate Focus and partner-based activities.   I am a licensed social worker but not a clinical social worker, meaning I am not licensed to diagnosis or treat mental illness.  I approach trauma from an integrative, relational, and strength-based perspective, not a medical model, and individual session work is just one part of my practice that predominately focuses on research and work that brings communities and organizations into regulation, safety, and health.






            Age 18 and older. Specializing in resolving trauma in the body, through touch-based or talk-based modalities, or both.  Touch-based work can be done in person or taught over video with a friend or partner, talk-based modalities by video only. Work with groups, such as organization leadership is contract-based.

            Are relationships a big source of your emotional pain? Working hard to find someone and it's not working? Tempted to violate an agreement or have already done so? Maybe you're overusing substances to cope or your loved one is battling addiction?





            When in these situations, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and want assistance. I imagine you want to feel grounded, to not have outside situations or people dictate your every move or mood. You want to be happier, contented, and satisfied. You are wanting to be and feel calm. I can help guide you to get to where you want to be.





            I am invested in your emotional health and happiness and will assist you in finding solution and solace by exploring embedded beliefs, automatic thoughts, and attachment issues that are shaping your outside life. I encourage you to set up a consultation to experience my result-oriented style in person and see if working together feels like a good fit.

        description: "I work with individuals 18 years and older, couples, and other family constellations including polyamorous families.  I particularly enjoy working with women, LGBTQ folks, and young adults.\n\n\n\n \n\nCommon issues people bring include child abuse, post-traumatic stress, relationships (including open, polyamorous and kinky relationships), depression, anxiety, LGBTQ , mid-life, work, and alcohol and other drugs. I also am interested in working with children/ grandchildren of Holocaust survivors, introverts, women who are sexually fluid in their orientation/identity, rural residents, military brats, academics, highly intelligent people, classical musicians, human service managers, and social justice advocates.\n\n\n\n \n\nI use a combination of techniques that best meet your needs, including psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, family systems, and solution-focused approaches.\n\n\n\n  \n\nMy underlying orientation is looking at the person(s) in environment, which includes a strong social justice commitment.  It is important to understand how issues such as lack of access to housing, a poor economy, homophobia, sexism, and racism impact upon what we perceive as our individual or family problems.\n\n\n\n  \n\nI can do therapy over the Internet if you are in California or Florida.  If you are on PHP/Beacon Medi-Cal in Sonoma, Marin and some other northern California counties, I can now do online therapy.\n\n\n\n \n\nMy standard hourly rate (50 minutes) is $130 with the initial intake at 80 minutes at $195. Sometimes I can reduce this rate.   I accept Medicare and Medi-Cal if you receive Medi-Cal through Partnership/Beacon and reside in Sonoma County or counties further north.  I can provide a superbill for other insurance companies."

        description: "I completed degrees in science and philosophy before qualifying as a counsellor, and I combine the analytic strength of these disciplines with the warmth of humanistic therapy. Following the person-centred approach, I believe that every person has the capacity within themselves for growth and healing. My job is to provide an empathetic and supportive environment for that capacity to unfold. My work is also influenced by cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), meaning that I help clients explore the unstated, often unhelpful, assumptions behind their responses to challenging situations. I also draw from various other theories and methods, including existential psychotherapy, transactional analysis, and mindfulness practices. I have read very broadly, within psychotherapy and related disciplines, and try to offer whatever I think would be helpful to each client as an individual without ever being prescriptive. \n\n\n\n\n\nI have had a varied career, and I believe that familiarity with the variety of human experience is one of my great strengths as a therapist. I approach each client with warmth, an open mind, and a sense of their unique perspective on the world. I particularly welcome inquiries from clients who may worry about judgement or misunderstanding. This includes people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual or otherwise embody gender, romantic and sexual diversity; people in non-monogamous relationships, who participate in BDSM, do any form of sex work, who use psychoactive drugs, belong to other minority groups, or who otherwise feel marginalised or under-served by the counselling profession. \n\n\n\n\n\nMy practice is based in South East London, and I try to offer flexible arrangements. I work both short- and long-term, and offer online session in addition to face-to-face. Please get in touch if you have any access needs or questions!"

            Trouble in your marriage? Feeling down or depressed? Having unpleasant thoughts or urges? You might be reaching out to a therapist for a variety of reasons. Finding the right fit for a therapist might sound daunting and often clients reach out when they don't know where to turn.

            I am a Psychotherapist in Mission Viejo, California. I have been working in the counseling field since 2015. I have worked with a variety of people which include children, adolescents, adults, couples, domestic violence and trauma survivors, LGBTQ, homeless, substance recovery, and alternative lifestyles. Although I service a range of needs, I have experience with depression, anxiety, self-esteem, trauma, domestic violence, LGBTQ, and alternative lifestyles. I have worked with children, focusing on play therapy and creating a team with parents and teachers to best support the client. I have worked with adolescents, using a mix of evidence-based therapy and play therapy. I have worked with adults struggling with depression, PTSD, bipolar, anxiety, and currently work at an inpatient hospital. What I have learned working with variety of people is that all clients are different and need a customized treatment plan to focus on what they are struggling with. I view our time together as a collaborative team. I focus on being empathetic, supportive, nonjudgmental, mindful, and a good listener. I am open to all cultures, individual styles, therapeutic needs, and have the flexibility that comes with many different types of people.





            My own personal life experiences, relational challenges, struggles and my continuing education/training provide me with experience, knowledge, and dedication to be the person and therapist I want to be. Honestly, it is not always easy to face our challenges, but I am available to support you in your life's challenges and goals in becoming the person you want to be. I look forward to working with you!

            I know how hard it can be to find the right psychotherapist and I understand that your experience with other counselors may have left you feeling judged or misunderstood. My greatest hope is that together we can overcome your challenges and build a bright future for you.





            As a licensed counselor and certified life coach, my primary goal is to provide you with a safe place to explore your thoughts, feelings and experiences. From this place of safety and trust, you can begin your healing journey.





            I can help you overcome depression, anxiety, trauma, family stress or chronic stress. As you already know, your  relationships with others are negatively impacted when you are in a mental health crisis. Let's work together to improve your mood and ability to cope with life's stressors.





            I offer online counseling across the state of Maryland. Telemental health is convenient, flexible and effective.  My rates are reasonable to eliminate barriers to treatment. I do not participate with insurance but I do offer Superbills so that you can submit claims for reimbursement.

        description: I'm passionate about working with individuals and couples in the polyamorous/open-relationship community, and I'm a member of this community myself. My style has a strong mindfulness and somatic basis, and I often guide clients through meditations at the beginning of sessions. If you're a couple, you can expect to experience exercises using eye contact and direct communication of in-the-moment experience to help you build intimacy. I utilize and teach Nonviolent Communication to help couples empathize with each other and communicate their own feelings more effectively. During this COVID-19 pandemic, I'm only doing video calls with clients, but I plan to see people in real life in my office when it is safe to do so. LGBTQ+ Friendly. Free Intro Phone Calls Offered.

            The desire to know one's self intimately and for that self to be known and safe in the presence of others is a vital part of the human experience. Therapy is a space where you can practice deepening intimacy with yourself, so that you can share yourself more fully with others. I am a sex-positive therapist who strives to create a safe, non-judgmental environment that is welcoming to all bodies, orientations, relationship configurations, and lifestyles. Your body is not wrong or broken; all of who you are is welcome here.





            I enjoy working with a variety of clients and issues. I am especially passionate about working with couples to increase emotional and sexual satisfaction, men's identity and sexuality issues, grief and loss, body image issues, and gender identity issues. I have significant experience working with queer and transgender clients.





            My counseling style is compassionate, collaborative, curious, and playful! I bring highly specialized training and knowledge of sexuality with me into our sessions, and have a particular gift at asking thought-provoking questions that help clients generate new insight into their experiences. My approach is integrative, combining emotionally focused therapy, solution-focused brief therapy, interpersonal neurobiology, mindfulness training, and self-compassion training.

            I am Rose your True Self Guide - destination you! I offer therapeutic and educative systems calling you home to your true self. I work online and in London with adults (including individuals, couples, polycules and groups) using the following approaches:





            1.  Origins: where do you come from?


            Discover how the past shapes your present and free your true self - family constellations





            2.  Emerging Self: who are you?


            Explore the imprint of your conception, birth and early years - rebirthing and breathwork therapy





            3.  Embodying Eros: what's your pleasure?


            Therapeutic and educative pleasure explorations for embodied souls - consent, touch and neo-Tantra teachings





            4.  Soul work: what's your purpose?


            Mentoring to unite what you do best with the people you can best serve - for practitioners who may want to build their own optimised website.





            Those are the tools and here's who holds them!





            I live in community and with my chosen family, we are GSRD. This is just my life - it is also the fruit of many years enquiry into home, family and how these might best reflect and nourish my true self.





            Because I am interested in your true self I am careful not to proselytize for any particular way of being. But perhaps simply knowing I hold a map not like the ones usually shown, may support you having the confidence to develop your own.

            Searching for a therapist to guide you on your journey towards healing, change, and empowerment can be time-consuming and daunting. Everyone has the right to quality and affirming care, and that starts from the first moment you reach out to me. I will strive to always provide a safe, open, and non-judgmental atmosphere that will foster the positive therapeutic alliance needed to help you achieve your goals. My approach is not one-size-fits-all, and I only see a limited number of clients, this allows us the opportunity to set a focus and pace you require along your path.






            I bring over 20 years prior background in mentorship with the US Army and YMCA, and over a decade of practical knowledge in suicide intervention techniques. As a Licensed Masters Social Worker, I have added two years of training and experience with individual, group, and couples therapy in a social work setting.





            If you or someone you care about could use help charting a better path, do not hesitate to contact me. My specialties include motivational interviewing, mindfulness, sleep hygiene, cultural humility, LGBTQ+ affirming care, and consensual non-monogamy/sex-positive awareness. I am also a National Coalition for Sexual Freedom Kink Aware Professional.

            Psychotherapist and Licensed Professional Counselor, offering Telehealth / Online Counseling for Addiction, Relationships, Sexuality, and Trauma. My ideal clients are working professionals that struggle to build their ideal lives. They struggle with anxiety, depression, anger, and trauma, which manifests in poor communication, troubled relationships, overwhelming addictions, and PTSD. They have busy schedules and are open to new technologies such as telehealth or online therapy.






            I have successfully worked with clients on a wide range of issues, including relationship communication and intimacy, anxiety and depression, gender and sexual identity and transition, addiction and recovery, and physical/sexual/emotional trauma and PTSD. I have worked in both private-practice and substance-abuse treatment settings. I am LGBTIQ, poly, and kink friendly and knowledgeable.






            Sharing and being vulnerable with another human being takes courage. I honor that courage by partnering with you to hear your story, create new narratives about your life experiences, teach you skills for dealing with overwhelming thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and help you discover communication tools that can enhance and strengthen your relationships.






            My standard session rate is $150 per 50 min session, payable via Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, and Health Savings Account. I am in the process of getting set up to accept Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance. I do have limited spots for a sliding scale on a case by case basis.

            I love working with couples and individuals who live lives that are authentic to them, whatever that may look like. I am kink-aware and I enjoy working with various relationship styles and sexual concerns. I'm currently completing my sex therapy education through Sexual Health Alliance.





            My therapy style is humanistic, and client centered. I believe it is important to meet you where you are at and hold the space for you to create the life you want. I add components of Emotionally Focused Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy where appropriate.





            Our therapeutic relationship acts as a soft-landing place in an oftentimes harsh world, as well as a space for education, empowerment, and authenticity. We will work together to identify core areas that need to be healed for you to create relationships with others and with yourself that you find fulfilling.






            To me, part of being a counselor is being an advocate. I believe in providing social, mental, and emotional support to vulnerable populations to reduce human suffering. Holistic health care is the way of the future. I love helping people approach their health in an integrative way. If it sounds like what you are looking for please reach out. I would love to work with you.

            My goal as a therapist is to partner with clients to build on their strengths and deepen their perspective into the transitions and challenges they face. I have extensive experience working within queer and poly communities, as well as with those who have lived through trauma. While my practice is rooted in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), I use a variety of techniques tailored to your needs. I am committed to using an anti-oppressive framework that explores how environments, relationships, and circumstances shape your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. I offer individual therapy and couples therapy to adults who are 18 and older. While each of my clients brings a unique set of experiences and challenges to therapy, some common areas of therapeutic focus include:





            * Stress





            * Anxiety





            * Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)





            * Depression





            * Trauma





            * Grief and loss





            * Gender identity





            * Sexuality





            * Polyamory / open relationships





            * Life transitions





            * School





            * Career

        description: "Having worked in numerous mental health & counselling situations, I have experience with clients of a wide range of life-style, ethnicity, gender identification, sexual orientation, and personal backgrounds.  Most of my experience has been with ages 14 and older.  I also have counselled clients showing a wide range of patterns of personal distress and symptoms.  For 28 years part of my job was to diagnose new clients in an outpatient clinic that served clients with problems ranging from mild adjustment to severe psychoses, and everyone in between.  In the decade since I retired from that clinic to focus on private practice, I have worked with both individuals and couples/triads who asked for help exploring alternative styles of relationship, gender identification, and sexuality. \n\n\n\n\n\nI have been trained in many styles of therapy and family/network/group intervention.  I try to tailor my offerings to the needs, goals, and values of the client(s) who seek my services.  In the area of traumatic stress, I am certified in EMDR (formerly called eye-movement-desensitization&-reprocessing... now I call it \"Emotional Memory Desensitization& Reprocessing\").  I was certified by California BBS as Hypnotherapist in 1982.  I have explored using various altered states to help clients.  This has included study and practice of Mindfulness Meditation which I apply to counselling situations.   I have also studied several \"Energy Meditations\" and \"Movement Meditations\".  Under my RN certification I have studied and offered massage and bodywork.  I draw from these varied trainings and experiences as tools to offer to clients what is acceptable, interesting, and useful to their development in life, in happiness, in consciousness, and in relating with others.\n\n\n\n\n\n Currently (July 2020) I am mainly offering sessions via video (zoom,etc). FtF sessions are still possible, if needed by clients."

I specialize in creative financial planning that goes above and beyond the strict one male + one female household while also keeping each individuals best interest in mind. You deserve to have a financial future that not only gets you through life, but also reflects your values as well. I would love to see how I can bring you and your finances in line with your best self.

        description: 'I work with relationships and individuals to improve communication and change patterns of behaviour. My approach to working with romantic relationships focuses on building communication and connection. When partners are able to communicate truthfully and listen attentively, it facilitates a connection that makes the hardships of life easier to bear. Partners will often end up in habitual patterns of interaction that leave everyone feeling frustrated and unfulfilled. The restorative process starts by hearing what each of you would like to be different in your relationship then exploring where these interactional patterns inhibit that goal. We will discuss what good communication looks like for both of you, and how you each need to speak so the other can hear. You can try these new communication styles both inside and outside of sessions. As you practice changing how you communicate, the emotional landscape of your relationship may shift and grow. People often reconnect to the deep love they feel for their partner, and use this solid foundation to build a new future. Sessions are available both online and in person.

        description: |-
            A Certified Clinical Trauma Professional, I am well prepared to assist tweens, teens, adults and families to address a wide range of issues, including PTSD, Depression, Anxiety Disorders, Addictions, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder, each of which is often related to past and recent traumatic events.





            I am trained in a wide range of therapeutic approaches, most of which fall under the heading of "Cognitive Behavior Therapy." These include Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Bilateral Stimulation (EMDR), Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT), Hypnotherapy and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT).





            A Board-Certified Master Addictions Counselor, I can help people with issues with alcohol, nicotine and other drugs, as well as "process addictions" such as gambling, online gaming, sex, pornography, etc.  I am not a big believer in the concept of "addiction" as applied to sex or pornography. I prefer to focus on changing those behaviors my clients find problematic, rather than making as to those behaviors' causes.





            I am almost violently nonjudgmental and feel that everyone should be free to live their lives to the fullest, so long as their behavior is fully consensual and not harmful to themselves or others. This includes a strong and committed belief that polyamory, monogamy, and pretty much any other consensual lifestyle is perfectly valid and healthy.





            A Holistic Sex Therapist, I integrate an understanding of the range of normal sexual behavior. I find that most sexual issues stem from misunderstandings and lack of information. In fact, even most physicians and therapists know very little about normal human sexuality! I do not assume that one's "kink" or "poly" lifestyle causes, or is even related to, the problems they experience in life.





            I am currently limited to working with people in the great states of Idaho and Utah, but I am seeking licensure in several other states. A Board Certified Telemental Health Provider, I have been doing video counseling for more than three years. Since physical touch is not a part of my practice, I find that there is nothing I cannot do via secure video that I couldn&APOS;t do in my office. I would love to talk with you to see how I might be able to help you live your best life.

        description: I help people who are in--or who are interested in--non-monogamous relationship structures form more satisfying relationships with the people they care about. As fulfilling as it can be to actively build the types of relationships you want in your life rather than using a cookie-cutter approach to dating or marriage, it can also be stressful--especially at the beginning--and full of seemingly contradictory experiences. It can feel terrifying--but also exhilarating--to move away from the scripts of our culture, our families of origin, our faith communities, and even our legal system, that 'true' love can only exist between two people. Non-monogamy can create a sort of emotional whiplash as one day we feel that all of the best parts of ourselves are affirmed in a new relationship that really clicks, only to be swept away in an overwhelming wave of jealousy and fear when a partner has that same experience with someone else and suddenly alarm bells are going off that we're about to lose everything and our partners don't care for us anymore. Or, maybe, this wasn't your idea. Maybe you're feeling powerless as your partner unilaterally decided that they wanted an open relationship and is charging ahead with the whole thing, accusing you of not affirming their new-found polyamorous identity when you express your concern, hesitation, or you ask for time to process. Or, maybe you've recognized your own innate capacity to love more than one person... but you still find yourself feeling frustrated, sad, and more alone than you want to be. If any of this sounds like what you're experiencing, I want to help. Call or email me today to get started with telehealth services in Rhode Island or Massachusetts, or visit my website at amatthewscounseling.wordpress.com to learn more.

I am a creative & passionate person both personally and professionally. I am a Licensed Professional Counselor, Registered Art Therapist, Certified Clinical Trauma Professional, and Certified Mental Health Integrative Medicine Provider. I believe in bringing a creative approach to all aspects of life. Art therapy allows me to bridge the gap for those that struggle with verbal expression by offering an alternate form of communication and self-expression to ensure a positive therapeutic experience.





            My counseling style is warm and inviting. I work with you to help identify your goals and encourage you to make therapy your own. Each therapeutic journey is personalized and unique to your needs. Areas of experience include anxiety disorders, mood disorders, impulse control disorders, self-harm, parenting skills, trauma, and grief.





            I am accepting of all populations to include LGBTQ-PIA+, BDSM/kink, poly/consensual non monogamy, spirituality, etc. I want to help you discover who you are and everything you can become. I want to help you create a life fueled by creativity & passion as well as find a side of life and yourself that you love.

            I am a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist in San Diego. I provide therapy to individual adolescents, adults, couples, and families. My therapeutic style is strength-based and I utilize positive psychology in my approach. I believe that we all have the strength within us to overcome any challenge that life throws our way - we may just need a little guidance and support to access and utilize those inner strengths. My main focuses include treating anxiety, stress management, disordered eating, poor body image, low self-esteem, trauma, depression, and relational difficulties. My services include: Eating Disorder Therapy, Anxiety Therapy, EMDR Therapy, Depression Therapy, Trauma Therapy, Teen Counseling, CBT Therapy and more.





            I am an eclectic therapist and I utilize many different therapeutic modalities depending on my client's current needs, circumstances, and overall personality. I believe there is no "one-size-fits-all" approach and every client must be offered support in an individual and unique way. I am also a Registered Yoga Teacher so I utilize an array of mindfulness-based approaches when appropriate, especially when working with anxiety, stress, and depression.





            My practice is poly-friendly, open to the LGBTQ+ community, gender non-conforming, cisgender, and heterosexual individuals. I meet the criteria for poly-friendliness due to experiences I have had working with clients, friends that identify as polyamorous and various articles I have read on the topic. I am trauma-informed and am also an EMDR clinician. I would love to help you access your inner strength.

        description: "While guidelines for monogamy are quite clear, polyamorous and non-monogomous relationhips can be much more nuanced and personalized. This break from tradition has potential for rich relationships and deep fulfillment, but often requires special attention and personalization. I work with individuals and couples looking to build care, empathy, patience, and communication for themselves and one other. Using a psychodynamic and relational approach I help clients explore how to feel safe and supported in their relationships. \n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to meet clients where they're at and I do my best to create a non-judgmental and sex-positive environment for those already in polyamorous and non monogomous relationships or those considering it. I work with people of all different sexual and gender orientations. I also work with people in the sex work, BDSM, kink, and fetish communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to reach out for a free 20 minute phone consultation to see if we'd be a good fit. Currently seeing clients through telehealth."

        description: Mental health is a journey and I feel privileged when someone allows me to travel part of their road with them. I have been practicing therapy for approximately 15 years in the area of general adult mental health including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and trauma response/processing, as well as personality disorders.  The Poly/BDSM/Kink community needs people who can allow a safe and accepting space for its members to process and work on issues that may be directly related to their lifestyle journey, their potentially complex and broad relationship landscapes, and self-exploration; as well as the wide and vast array of issues that every person faces both inside and outside of the community. I offer my space as a sanctuary that allows people the opportunity and freedom to express themselves fully and without fear and to find solutions in their lives.

        description: 'My goal as a clinical psychologist is to help motivated adults to identify what they want out of life, figure out what''s getting in their way, and overcome those obstacles to achieve the lives they want. I am particularly interested in working with clients in the kink and polyamory communities, as well as the wider geeky/nerdy communities with which those often overlap. Whatever you''re into, chances are I''ve heard of it, I won''t be shocked by it, and I won''t leap to conclusions about you based on it. I work with adults of all ages and genders (I identify as male myself). For more information, please see my practice website and/or call or email to set up an initial appointment. Your initial contact will be received by my colleague, Dr. Sarah Gray, who can discuss payment options and other issues and schedule an initial appointment with me. She will ask for some information about your therapy goals, but it is perfectly acceptable to wait to share information about your sexuality (if you so choose) until you have had a chance to meet and get comfortable with your therapist.  Note: currently all therapy is remote; remote therapy will likely remain available even once in-person sessions resume.'

            I've often wondered where the phrase "falling in love" came from.  The "in love" part sounds great, but the hazard of "falling" is that most people get hurt when they fall.  I am as much a romantic as the next person, but I'm not in favor of stumbling headfirst into a relationship (as opposed to a fling) without considering all the known risks and benefits - "known" being the crucial word.  There are so many unknowns about a partner or lover that we only discover by being in relationship with them, that it behooves us to intelligently consider the known aspects as we face them.  I'm of the belief that we do not choose who we fall in love with, which has some inherent risks, so the more insight we can gather about all the parties in the relationship, the better our chance of success will be.





            As a therapist, I believe the best way - indeed, the only way - to face the challenges in any intimate relationship is with fearless honesty.  How can I trust that my lover's acceptance of me is genuine if I have not shown him or her my true self?  But being vulnerable in a relationship is a scary proposition, and sometimes you may need the help of someone else.  As a therapist, I am in a unique position to guide and coach you into learning to develop that habit of honesty, which is essential to safe and healthy intimate relationships.  For ethical non-monogamous, polyamorous, or throuple relationships, the need for honesty among all parties is even more essential, and I will honor every risk you take in therapy.  I will be your ally, without judgment or shame, as I support you through your journey.

            My services include individual and relational counseling for adult individuals and couples and occasionally I work with teens. I have an extensive background working with individuals who have survived unwanted sexual experiences and other forms of trauma.  This extensive background now includes years of training and experience with EMDR, helping with desensitization and reprocessing for those in need of healing from trauma, phobias, and distressing memories (including PTSD).  Not only am I poly-curious and non-monogamy friendly, but I also enjoy working with folks who identify as kinky and folks who are LGBTQIA. Folks have called me an ally, and one of my previous teen trans clients informed me that "being an ally only means that one cares." My reply was that makes my week and I will not forget your shared words.





            My fees are currently discounted due to the pandemic as follows: Individuals $75 and couples $100. I just added a group at therapyDen.com with the per group member fee of $25 per 90min group session, and the group is listed as on-going and meeting at 12pm on Saturdays at my private practice suite group room.

In regard to what I have found in this experience, especially working with eating disorders and substance use recovery, is that what seems to be missing with the recovery process is a sexual recovery component. \n\n\n\n\n\nI feel that who I am, my authenticity, my message, and showing my humanness sets me apart from many therapists trained to be a blank slate for their clients.

I have experience working with polycules, poly-curious couples, and many other types of relationships. I also enjoy working with children of all ages, as well as their families. As a marriage and family therapist, I have been trained to do therapy with a person's "system," even when they are coming in for individual therapy services. I use a variety of different techniques, including mindfulness, narrative therapy, sandtray, and play therapy. At this time, I am in the process of being paneled with various insurance companies; I also accept cash clients. Please call to see if I am in network for you!

I have completed Gottman Level 1, conflict resolution training, facilitation training, and attend annual poly, kink, and sex positive conferences, I have completed trainings in STAIR (skills training and interpersonal relationships) and narrative therapy. My modalities include drawing on solution focused therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, narrative, and gestalt; all in a trauma informed practice. I prefer an eclectic approach to helping people that is suited to the client and their needs and goals. \n\n\n\n\n\nI believe that polyamory can be an identity to some and a choice to others and that it is a spectrum like many things in life. Polyamorous configurations come in many forms and can be descriptively or prescriptively hierarchal, egalitarian or solo poly, some who are ethically non-monogamous identify as Relationship Anarchists. I am comfortable helping people in any configuration, including poly-mono, quads, triads, and open format polyamory. I believe the client is the expert in their life and my role is to provide tools and skills to help affirm choices and authenticity. I am gender affirming, polyamorous and kink friendly and will meet you where you are at in your journey, whether it is opening up, seasoned in non-monogamy, or working through breaches of trust. I am able to help anyone over the age of 10.\n\n\n\n\n\nGROUP OFFERING: I am running a relationship reset group that is open to individuals and couples and looks at consent, boundaries, communicating needs and wants and more. I have 3 slots left at $162 and 3 slots at $270. The group begins May 3 and runs for 6 weeks. Sessions are 90 minutes and will be from 7pm -830pm PST."

        description: I offer individual therapy with an intention to cocreate a working relationship and environment that is collaborative, non-judgmental, but challenging and attentive to allow for the exploration of life experiences. I incorporate harm reduction, feminist, trauma, and psychodynamic theories with the inclusion of anti-racist and social justice lenses while attending to resilience. Primarily, I work with the queer and trans/GNC communities and with persons who identify as poly, non-monogomous, and kink. Additionally, my practice focuses on work with persons who have survived complex trauma, childhood sexual abuse, childhood neglect, dissociative disorders, IPV, and substance use/addiction. I work with both adolescents and adults and I am credentialed with some insurance plans.

            I believe that everyone is doing the best they can, with the tools they have, in the given moment. Sometimes, that means things are going great! Feeling grounded, centered and content. Other times, things are...well...not-so-great.







            Perhaps you're feeling stuck and need help figuring out your goals. Maybe you've been putting off an important conversation, or your home or work life feels unbalanced and disorganized. It may be that you want to change (or change has come to you) and you  - or you and your partner(s) - could use some help figuring out what's next.








            The Department of Practical Sunshine provides coaching, facilitation and strategy services with the goal of helping people solve problems and develop plans for growth and evolution. As a certified sexuality educator and transformation life coach, I welcome the opportunity to support those in the poly community and bring an understanding of some of the unique challenges and opportunities that being in the community can bring! My approach is warm, open and goal-oriented, and I offer a free 15 minute consultation to make sure we're a good fit.





            Coaching services include: Career + Life; Purpose + Motivation; Wellness + Sexuality; Communication; Yoga + Embodiment.





            Facilitation services include: Difficult Conversations; Partner Alignment; Accountability; Conflict Management; Workshops + Trainings.





            Strategy services include: Projects + Goals; Time + Task Management; Efficiency + Productivity; Workplace Wellness; Home Organization.

Access to a pro is even more necessary when you are poly due to archaic marriage laws. \n\n\n\n\n\nI can help you identify your financial goals, how to arrange finances so no one is left vulnerable and finally, help you implement the plan.  On an ongoing basis, I work to keep you on track.  \n\n\n\n\n\nI serve all ages and can help with retirement planning, education savings, and other financial goals.  The minimum to invest with me is $5,000, I make my money off any fees or commissions generated when you invest; meetings are free.  I am very up front about what it will cost you and I will tell you if you'd be better served at a discount house. \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can put a group of three or four families who just want an hour or two to ask questions and get generalized answers, I'm happy to do that too.  I don't charge for those because making this information widely known and available is more important to me than making money."

            Counseling is a partnership.





            The goal is to help you live a better life, have better relationships, and feel better being you.





            I know how hard it is to ask for help. The decision to find a therapist often comes at times of stress and change. I am a supportive, non-judgmental therapist. Together we will identify your goals, recognizing and building on your strengths and unique qualities. We will find realistic, reasonable strategies that work for you. I am a LGBTQIA-Affirming, sex-positive therapist. My pronouns are she/her/hers. I accept many insurances and private pay/out of network. I serve adults and seniors.

            I'm a trained surrogate partner and intimacy coach working in the Greater Washington, DC Metro Area and beyond.





            I work with people who want to experience more healthy, consensual, and joyful intimacy in their lives -- including working through feelings of sexual shame, inadequacy, inexperience, trauma, or dysfunction. I work with adults of all ages, genders, and sexual orientations. As a transgender woman, I have a special interest in working with transgender people as well as their partners.





            As a surrogate partner, I work in collaboration with a client and their talk therapist to create a process for learning, skill-building, and healing. This can include guiding clients through exercises that help build their awareness and connection to their own bodies, desires, and emotions, and build skills for communication and all levels of connection and intimacy. I speak and work in English.

My primary focus areas are exploring & supporting identity development (racial identities, LGBTQ+ identities, etc), developing healthy relationships, improving communication, processing trauma, understanding family dynamics, & resolving conflicts. I am open to working with anyone who thinks they would be a good fit, but in general, I tend to be process-oriented, often focusing on how different dynamics impact clients' experiences.

            I most value building trusting relationships with my clients and strive to offer a nonjudgmental listening space. I believe that clients have the right, and the ability, to make the best decisions for themselves.

As that which is no longer unwanted is released from the body, clients are helped to open up to feeling more pleasure in the body, and more joy and positivity in their lives. I also deal specifically with sexual trauma, such as rape and assault, and sexual dysfunctions. Services are offered to those in England, both in Teesside and in London. A typical session is 4-5 hours long and costs 250 pounds (350 pounds in London). Online Skype coaching sessions are also offered. Please see my website for more details, or contact me.

            If you're currently in an ethically non-monogamous relationship, it's quite likely that you've been on quite a journey already. Pulling yourself loose from the world's one-dimensional narrative on love, and instead defining your own rules isn't always easy. I celebrate you in your courage, and understand how important it is to have a therapist who is able to relate. My stance and philosophy are explicitly inclusive, regardless of ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual expression, or the way you want to shape your relationship.





            Most of my clients are aged 20-45 and all find relief in the safety, warmth and openness that we create together in our sessions.





            I'm a psychologist trained in **Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)**, and specialize in **relationship therapy**. EFT is an empirically validated method based on attachment theory, with the best results of any couple therapy currently out there. It can be successfully applied to polyamorous relationships.  I also provide individual therapy to those who seek to regain balance, clarity, and a renewed sense of inner peace.





            Fluent in English and Dutch, I offer both in-person sessions in Amsterdam and online sessions. Feel free to check out my website anlacan.com for advice on my blog, or to schedule a free introductory meeting!

My center is designed to help us heal from those influences. For over 15 years I've devoted my career as a therapist to working primarily with LGBTQ people. My work as a couples counselor is influenced by Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy (EFT). I have completed an externship with Sue Johnson, the founder of EFT, and I continue to do advanced training with the International Centre for Excellence in Emotionally Focused Therapy. It is one of the most researched forms of couples counseling and has been proven to be one of the most effective. While I work with all kinds of people, the focus of my work, blogs and videos, and charitable giving is the LGBTQ community. Whether you're struggling with self-worth, anxiety, depression, isolation, or intimacy issues, we're here to help you live the life you want. \n\n\n\n\n\nInsurance + Cost: Out of network. Ask your provider, \"what is your reimbursement rate for out of network procedure code 90834?\" If you are looking for couples counseling ask them, \"what is your reimbursement rate for out of network procedure code 90847?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI am happy to provide you with receipts that include all the detailed codes required by insurers. Psychotherapy is also typically covered by pre-tax Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) or Health Spending Accounts (HSAs)."

            Therapy is an opportunity to build trust in yourself and others, redefine your sense of self, choose your values, shift your relationship to the past, and create a life of meaning and engagement. I provide a contained space to have challenging, growth interactions as you create safety individually and together. I present ideas and ways of interacting, and you collaborate to create what is a good fit for you. There is no one right way to have relationships - only what is right for your relationship values.





            Populations served: I work with adults, older adults, couples/dyads, and poly relationship systems. I specialize in working with trans* patients, poly and consensual non-monogamy patients, LGB patients, kink and BDSM practitioners, patients experiencing complex trauma, and intersectional identity exploration.





            Fees: I am cash only, and I can provide a superbill for you to submit claims to your insurance provider. I offer discounted rates for AHCCCS patients. Individual sessions: 50-55 min, $175, Dyad (2) relationship sessions: 1hr 15 min, $250, Polycules/relationship systems: time and cost depend on specific circumstances.

        description: I love working with relationships and families of all types. Our relationships are the foundation of our lives and when there is a problem it often impacts everything. Problems often become more noticeable during times of change (such as beginning or ending a relationship, having children, death of a loved one, moving, or a job change) and can build up over time until they break the relationship. People often report having problems with communication, conflict management, intimacy, boundaries, parenting, and finances. People often want to feel heard, understood, respected, connected, safe, and loved. They want to feel like their values and needs are honored in the relationship and they want to be a team. I specialize in working with people to develop strong relationships through positive communication and clear boundaries. I am an English speaking clinician that works from a solution focused framework which focuses on moving forward and building on past and current strengths and resources. I accept private pay and will provide a detailed receipt for those who would like to apply for reimbursement from their insurance. My intake sessions are 90-minutes and $150 and subsequent sessions are 60-minutes and $100. I do offer a sliding fee program for clients who need financial support in order to access services. The sliding fee program is based on family size and monthly income to provide a percentage of discount off the normal service fee.

            It takes continuous work and investment in one's relationships to practice healthy polyamory.  I work with clients to be active builders and creators of their intimate relationships, and to grow in their ability to organize others to be supportive of them and their life choices.





            Social therapeutics is a framework for emotional and relational growth. The approach is most powerful in group settings. I work with poly clients individually and in poly-relationship groups. I also lead groups focused on emotional growth that include both polyamorous and monogamous clients. My practice is LGBT-friendly.





            As a coach, I can legally share my experiences and work with clients anywhere in the US and world. My clientele is multiracial, multiclass and international.  Sessions held on zoom.





            I offer a sliding scale, so as to be as inclusive as possible. In addition to English, I am fluent in Italian.

            Hi, I'm Jess. I believe therapy is a collaborative process grounded in a trusting, therapeutic relationship. In my role, I provide the compassionate space for you to begin self-reflection and explore ways to initiate changes in your life. The therapy relationship becomes the safe, working model to practice communication. Part of my style is helping you embrace uncertainty in the transformation process, clarify your values, and explore your relationship with your thoughts, emotions, and body.





            I am a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) and have certifications as a Certified Clinical Trauma Specialist for individuals (CCTS-I) and as a Board Certified-TeleMental Health Provider (BC-TMH). I completed a training with the Phoenix Children's Hospital on working with gender expansive youth. I practice as a LGBTQIA++, Poly, Kink affirmative clinician.





            I work with children, adolescents, and adults as well as families, couples, and moresomes and have experience coordinating care with other supportive services and settings. I believe people are incredibly resilient, and I strive to practice in holistic ways that incorporate the body, culture, intersectional identities, and community into the healing process.

        description: |-
            I work with people ages 15 and older on a myriad of topics. I am especially interested in working with interracial relationships, first/second generation immigrants, queer folx, BIPOCs, men, and sex workers. Areas of specialities include mindfulness, BDSM, gender, ethical non-monogamy, social justice, anxiety, depression, sex therapy, neurodiversity, and trauma.





            I provide therapy that is grounded in social justice, queer and feminist theories, and cultural humility. My approach to therapy uses a blend of narrative, attachment-based, and body-focused techniques. In working with intimate relationships, I additionally draw from Emotion Focused and Gottman Method therapies. To put it simply, this means I place you at the center of your own story. I incorporate mind-body connection, emotional experiences, and relationships of all kinds into the therapy space. I truly believe that you deserve to live your best life, and I am here to offer whatever help I may toward that end. I completed my M.S. in marriage and family therapy with a focus on sex therapy at the University of Wisconsin-Stout.





            As a child of immigrant parents, I have lived my life in multiple cultures, giving me a unique perspective to the ways in which race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class may impact someone's experiences. Due to my own upbringing and education, I work to include these same aspects of life into the therapy room. I don't presume to know exactly what my clients have been through, but I do know what it is like to navigate the world in a body that has judgments thrust upon it. I want to use that knowledge to validate my clients' identities and offer support or, possibly, new understandings of the ways these experiences influence the rest of their lives. Though social justice and anti-racism work inform much of my practice, my values rest on centering and working with all forms of marginalization (race, gender, sexuality, class, ability, etc.).

        description: You're invited! Low cost, no insurance needed relationship and mental health counseling for 18+ serving all of New York State by telehealth. I have lived experience with polyamory and am also a member of the LGBTQ2IA+ community, and I believe in the beauty of all people. I support neurodiversity, believing that none of us are "broken and recovering" from mental illness, but that ALL of us have "mental difference" and are on a journey of discovery to live at our best. I also believe in body positivity and promote the idea that beautiful and sexy is not about what you weigh, but about the way you live. My therapy is values-based, helping you become also your truest, most fulfilled self as you also become healthier, allowing you to develop self esteem and become someone you're truly proud of. I am very openminded, respect all spiritual paths and belief systems, have worked in the mental health field in various roles for a decade, and really want to meet you. Please reach out to me today- you don't need to face anything alone anymore.

            It takes continuous work and investment in one's relationships to practice healthy polyamory.  I work with clients to be active builders and creators of their intimate relationships, and to grow in their ability to organize others to be supportive of them and their life choices.





            Social therapeutics is a framework for emotional and relational growth. The approach is most powerful in group settings. I work with poly clients individually and in poly-relationship groups. I also lead groups focused on emotional growth that include both polyamorous and monogamous clients. My practice is LGBT-friendly.





            As a coach, I can legally share my experiences and work with clients anywhere in the US and world. My clientele is multiracial, multiclass and international.  Sessions held on zoom.





            I offer a sliding scale, so as to be as inclusive as possible. In addition to English, I am fluent in Italian.

        description: "I understand trauma, the difficulties faced by us all when we try to learn past our intergenerational patterns. I am here for parents and caregivers who want to do their best for their families. I also welcome clients who want to be better caregivers to themselves. This includes anyone dealing with depression, anxiety, addictive behavior, unprocessed childhood experiences, or failure to create healthy connections with others.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor individuals, couples, and families I provide a partnership that improves compassion, respect, and the ability to truly be heard and understood. Exploring the past, owning unhelpful ideas, making connections between values and actions help us grow confidence, strength, and self-acceptance and the ability to shape the future we want with confidence. I can help you thrive. \n\n\n\n\n\nI became a therapist to provide folx with the tools to build a secure & safe world themselves. I have endured many of the pitfalls that prevent this mindset, and know the value of liberation first hand. I have partnered with an agency that supports a variety of difficulties with a commitment to seeing change occur one heart at a time."

            I am a trauma-informed Mindfulness therapist who believes that a balanced mindset will help to empower, uplift clarity, and motivate success and happiness. I have experience working with adolescents and young adults from communities of color who have complex life issues. I do also welcome partnerships with adults who want to build wellbeing practices. My working style gives clients a safe space to find authentic expression about their life's struggles and build healthy solutions that produce positive perspective and empowerment.





            I am happy to support couples with premarital and polyamorous agreements. For couples and families, I host collaborations that cultivate insight, develop open-hearted dialogue, and increases relational harmony. I help clients overcome limiting beliefs, resolve obstacles that derail their collaboration, and elevate mutual strengths, joy, and potential for deep connection. I coach from a firm embrace of ethical and cultural boundaries for conscious coupling.

        description: 'I am an Army O.E.F. veteran who evolved into a marriage and family therapist after a major reconsideration of my values and purpose in this life. My passion is supporting others in their personal transformation and evolution to become their greatest idea of themselves in their life. I offer individual, relational, sex & family therapy in Fort Collins, CO. I currently work at Colorado State University in counseling services and operate my private practice part-time. I grew up in Las Vegas before moving to CO for graduate school and I took a wide variety of classes focusing on sexuality from various departments: public health, anthropology, marriage & family therapy and fine arts. Living in Las Vegas provided me a unique environment to learn about human sexuality, desire, lust, kink, affairs, and more. I aspire to become an AASECT certified sex therapist, which motivates me to work with clients with concerns around sexuality/relationships. Clients who have worked with me have appreciated that I am unique as a therapist due to my balance of being compassionate and direct, curious and real, analytical and playful. I fully support CNM, Kink, and LGBTQIA people and I would be honored to meet with you to see if we will work well together. Thank you for your interest and please reach out for a free consultation to explore how you can experience more authenticity in yourself and your relationships to bring about the change you seek.'

        description: Jaxx Alutalica (they/them) is a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and AASECT Certified Sex Therapist with extensive experience working with poly relationship systems and the individuals in them. In addition to understanding the nuances of non-monogamy, they also specialize in working with BDSM/kink, gender identity exploration and gender transition, folx engaged presently or formerly in sex work, those healing from sexual trauma, and navigating issues of sex and sexuality with oneself and others. Jaxx engages with therapy through a trauma-informed lens that incorporates the experience of the body as well as the mind and spirit in order to facilitate healing of the whole self. Therapy with Jaxx is informed by a social and sexual justice perspective, incorporating somatic and holistic approaches to create a safe space for you to explore the impact of privilege, colonization, sexism, homophobia, fatphobia, transphobia, racism, ableism and other "isms" which impact our experience. For Jaxx, being a therapist is about connecting with people in ways that are vulnerable, honest, and genuine. Jaxx's approach is body-focused, experiential, and research-informed. They utilize an intersectional approach to their work, which considers that our identities affect the way we show up in our personal lives and in relationships. By continually considering topics of gender, sexuality, race, class, faith, disability, and other intersectional identities, Jaxx's clients are able to bring their whole selves into therapy without fear of judgment or restriction.

            Over 25 years of experience in the service of erotic embodiment and cultural evolution.





            Specializing in supporting sex workers, queer, gender expansive, poly, kink, bdsm, cannabis pioneers, psychonauts, and spiritual practitioners.





            I celebrate the rule-breakers, the bad-assess, and the iconoclasts! You have directly participated in the evolution of culture, and sexuality itself.  And sometimes being an "evolutionary" can be damn exhausting!





            There is no shame in admitting that it isn't happening in the sack, or that you don't feel great about yourself, or that your body is changing in ways that don't make sense.





            It's not always easy to find a space to be vulnerable, particularly when others project invulnerability (or worse) onto you because of what you do or how you love. It can be hard to ask for what you need, or want. Even if you're supposed to be so damn good at that very thing.





            Together let's create a safe space for you to take off that gorgeous, but heavy armor, and let your tender rawness breathe, be loved, be centered.





            I got you.





            The bulk of my clients come in with concerns around differing desire levels, erotic confidence issues, erectile reliability, climax control, pain during sex, and issues related to menopause and aging.





            You guide our work together, not a proscribed curriculum or modality.  I have a bunch of fantastic tools and perspectives, and decades of experience supporting hundreds of people. We will pull from whichever of those frameworks light you up, turn you on, and make you feel more alive!





            Please check out my website. I get very vulnerable on the "About" page, and I look forward to connecting with you.

        description: As someone who struggles to feel connected to themselves sexually but is ready to end that cycle, you may find that you feel unfulfilled and there is no end to the effects of trauma, stress, or sexual shame and stigma. Your sexual practices and experiences may be creating personal anxiety or stress, relationship distress, or feelings of loneliness.  Maybe you have tried therapy before, and you didn't feel like you could talk about sex or you felt judgment or shame regarding your sexual experience. It can be scary to give therapy another chance when you are already dealing with so many obstacles and yet you feel driven to get in tune with sexual desires. Imagine what it would be like to find that sense of hope again and create the connection that you have been searching for with yourself and with partner(s). Together, I want to help you understand and accept yourself and your value while still creating change that brings about harmony.  While I am able to work with a number of mental health issues, my primary focus of practice is sexuality. Whether working to connect with yourself sexually after a trauma, exploring Kink/BDSM, Consensual Non Monogamy, and more, I am here to help you discover your sexual power in a safe, affirming and empowering way.

As a Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor, I have experience working with individuals, couples, and polyam folx on a wide variety of issues including depression, anxiety, relationships, self-esteem, LGBTQIA+, marital, grief, and stress-related issues. As of late, my personal life journey has lead me to develop a passion for working with individuals, couples, and polyam folx dealing with relationship concerns, gender identity, human sexuality, intimacy, and sexual dysfunction issues.





            I bring a unique mix of experience and innovation when working with my clients. I believe it is important to create a sex-positive culture to facilitate growth in each individual. I want to create an environment that makes clients both feel at ease, while also allowing them the freedom to express any emotion they are experiencing.





            My practice is dedicated to nurturing sex positivity and inclusivity. Clients will find an open and honest therapist who is genuine to his core. My door is open to individuals of all genders, races, religions, sexual orientations, and cultures. I work with teenagers and adults ages 16+. I work with English-speaking individuals.

            I offer life coaching services for neurodivergent individuals and their families. I especially enjoy working with people on the autism spectrum, with ADHD, and those struggling with sensory regulation concerns. I support personal development, life skills development, and communication.





            I also enjoy working with new neurodivergent parents who would like support in developing a parenting style and skills, discipline techniques that align with their values, and resources to better understand their parenting goals and their child's specific needs.





            As an autistic person myself, parenting an autistic child, an ADHD child, and with an ADHD partner, I have a unique understanding of the daily challenges neurodiverse people face. I can help you identify your individual goals and create a specific, personalized plan to improve your independent living skills, parenting skills, social skills, and general well-being.





            I believe autism, ADHD, and other neurodivergences are neurological differences, not diseases to be cured.





            I am queer and offer a safe space for other GLBTQA+ folks, as well as poly/ENM folks.





            I believe in gentle, collaborative parenting techniques, and have seen them work wonders for families with young ADHD-ers and autistics.





            I have experience working with sensory processing differences, pathological demand avoidance, oppositional defiance, social anxiety, and learning differences.





            I believe in strength-based, evidence-based assessment and skill-building.





            As a life coach, I help you clarify YOUR needs and help you create a plan to meet YOUR goals.





            I offer email, video, and phone consultations with clients all over the world. I offer multi-session discounts and some sliding scale options for folks with demonstrated financial need. Email me for more information today, or to book a FREE 20 minute listening session so we can learn more about each other and see if we're a good fit together. I look forward to hearing from you!

        description: "I specialize in open, nonmonogamous relationships such as polyamory and swinging, alternative lifestyles such as kink / BDSM, LGBT+, and secular or alternative faiths such as paganism. Trying to live more freely and authentically can be hard. Some struggle feeling something is wrong with them. Some people have just been polybombed, the love of their life seeming to say they're not enough. Others, having taken the leap can't seem to stop fighting. Feeling isolated, scared, tired, and like they're going to lose everything. \n\n\n\n\n\nTake a moment to imagine your life as it could be in a few months. You are in love, all over again. With your partner, a new partner, yourself, and how you live. Accepted for who you are, allowed to love in a way that feels natural, you are excited about your new life. \n\n\n\n\n\nComing into alternative worlds, I saw people go to amazing therapists who just didn't understand. I watched friends spend the first few sessions teaching very experienced counsellors the vocabulary of their lifestyles. I believe you deserve a therapist that understands. If you live differently and want a therapist that can hear you, message or call me for a free consultation."

I am currently part of the Sexual Health Alliance program to pursue my sex therapy certification. \n\n\n\n\n\nI look forward to creating a safe therapeutic relationship with you so that you have a place to process your past, your present life experiences, and the direction you want to go to build your future."

            When you step into my office you will be warmly greeted in a judgement-free setting. The therapeutic process starts with a thorough assessment to really get to know who you are and where you are at, because the issues you have don't define who you are as a person. We will work together to identify the problem areas and employ the therapeutic process to foster growth.





            I believe the therapeutic process needs to be direct, honest, and specifically tailored to the nuances of you and your situation. Certification in Sex Therapy and in Consensual Non-Monogamy through Sexual Health Alliance is in progress. I have a niche for seeing polyamorous or open-relationship clients!





            My personal brand of therapy allows you to separate you from your issues and rewrite the story of your life to reflect who you truly are.

She often hears, \"I can't even draw a stick figure!\" Yet in her experience, many of these same folks go on to discover creative depths within themselves that serve as vital tools in their own healing.\n\n\n\n\n\nCollaborating with people to tell their stories through expressive arts (visual art, drama, dance, music) provides new and often-surprising results. Creative activities have been proven to facilitate healing from trauma, provide stress relief, release the capacity for self-expression, and encourage empowerment and recovery. \n\n\n\n\n\nMaking comic books is her own form of self-care, and her art has been published in magazines and social media.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarmine collaborates with teens and adults individually, or as part of couples and group therapy, on needs ranging from trauma and substance use recovery to mind-body wellness. Carmine welcomes LGBTQI+ clients of all ages.  Profile at https://www.psychologytoday.com/profile/478519"

            Hypnotherapy is incredibly effective for healing a vast array of issues, and I am always honored to be of service to my community. I specialize in helping clients heal from trauma, work through sexual issues, get to the root of relationship issues, and access their own inner strength and guidance. I witness the power of this work daily and am so excited to share it with the world.





            I am LGBTQ+ friendly and kink-aware. I am femme-presenting and genderqueer, and grew up socialized as a girl/women. I am particularly interested in serving clients who share any of these demographics with me, or have loved ones who do.

            Hello, I'm Caera Gramore. I offer mental health therapy and support in building emotional skills and relational skills through a compassion-based whole-person-in-environment approach. I enjoy assisting clients as they grow and learn, build new relational skills, work through various life challenges, and meet their own personal goals. My passion is to support clients to live a fulfilling life for themselves, knowing that this will look different from one individual to another.





            I work with many therapeutic modalities and frameworks, including Trauma-Informed Approach, Relational-Cultural Therapy (RCT), Cultural Humility, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), Motivational Interviewing (MI), Recovery Model, Solution Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT), Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT), Strengths-Based Approach, and Mindfulness.





            I have experience in supporting clients through various life events including rebuilding one's supports after a loss of previous supports, various stages of recovery from addiction, discovering and building on personal and cultural strengths, navigating challenging systems, and accessing additional resources.





            I am a gender affirming, LGBTQIA+ friendly, poly friendly, diverse-ability affirming, sex positive, body positive, sex worker friendly, culturally inclusive therapist. I have enjoyed working with members of various populations, including LGBTQIA+ people, people with disabilities and/or chronic illness, unhoused people, and systems-involved people.





            My practice is based in Arlington, WA, but I can see clients anywhere in Washington state via teletherapy. I charge $100 per session. I do not accept any insurance, but I can provide a superbill receipt which some insurances will reimburse. For questions or to book an appointment, call 360-336-6349 or email caera@ourhealingmatters.com , or book online for a free 15 minute consultation at www.ourhealingmatters.com

        description: After 10 years of indigent defense, I opened my own trauma-informed law firm to provide services in estate planning, small business (formation and contracting), and trauma-informed HR consulting. I specifically want to serve non-traditional families (poly and non-married partners) in the area of estate planning and contracting. Estate planning is one of the best tools to ensure protection for non-married partners, not only in terms of assets but legal access (POA's). I offer a poly specific consultation for polycules to discuss options for resource sharing and protection. While we keep working on changing laws to afford non-married partners the same rights as married couples, we have to get creative with our current legal tools to do what we can to protect the rights of non-married partners beyond the typically fraudulent concept of the "family llc." I currently practice in Washington only. My poly-specific consultation and simple estate planning (will + POA + medical directive) are offered as flat-rate services at reasonable prices. If my rates are unaffordable for any specific person or group, I encourage communication with me to see if we can work something out. I believe in my services and I strive to be accessible to all.

            Finding a good fit in a professional, when in a consensually non-monogamous relationship, can be a challenge. I provide relationship and sex therapy that honors the complexity, nuance, joys and challenges of navigating life and relationships within a non-monogamous context.





            There is no "right" way to be in relationship. Many people identify as ethically non-monogamous, polyamorous, or open, and often have unique perspectives and needs. I believe we can feel most empowered, free and connected to our deepest selves and define our own relationships, whatever those configurations and boundaries may look like.  Having the support of a mental health professional who is well-versed on aspects of non-monogamy, can help you and your partner(s) to negotiate challenges to intimacy. This can be especially true for couples who are in the initial stages of "opening" their relationship. I love working with intimate partners in defining and exploring what relationships means to them and supporting their choices. I have cultivated a safe space for you on your journey to explore and communicate your needs, promote honesty, connection, authenticity, and trust.

        description: My approach to therapy is rooted in anti-oppression and liberatory principles, seeking to honor each person's individuality and autonomy. Much of my experience is working with people of color and queer and trans/gender non-conforming people. I have extensive training in trauma practice, particularly around experiences of abuse, violence, and intergenerational trauma. I draw from a variety of therapeutic techniques, including psychodynamic therapy, Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, Internal Family Systems, mindfulness, and other relational and somatic approaches. I am a queer, mixed-race Asian American of Uchinanchu and Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and my therapy space is warm and collaborative, fostering individuals' ability to build resilience, joy, and power.

            I'm Mary Clark, I'm a Relationship Anarchy-ish coach, and I can help you to create the life and the relationships you want. I use Zoom for our meetings, so I work with clients all over the world. If you're feeling confused or "stuck", I can help you get unstuck. We can sort through the confusion together. We can talk one-on-one, or you can bring one or more friends/partners/loved ones, and I'll help you figure out what's healthiest for each of you.





            It's rare to find counselors and therapists who understand Relationship Anarchy, with its lack of hierarchy, lack of relationship escalators, and its abundance of individual styles. On the other hand, I don't care if you're "Relationship Anarchist enough". There's no judgment here. My focus is on helping you follow your own inner compass toward maximum happiness and health.





            I'm queer, but you don't have to be. I'm a Relationship Anarchist, and was polyamorous before I found out about RA. I'm extremely accepting of all people, including but not limited to straight, gay, transgender, nonbinary, intersex, asexual, graysexual, aromantic, gray-romantic, bisexual, pansexual, and all kinds of other folks. Basically, just tell me about yourself, because I'm not going to make assumptions.





            I can help you to:





            * Navigate RA and/or polyamory regardless of your current relationship configuration(s), including if you're already married, and/or if you have children at home.





            * Deal with jealousy when it's not just jealousy? (Hint: these are often signs of past trauma and attachment injuries, in which case, we need special care!)





            * Navigate manage mismatched attachment styles, when one of you wants more closeness, and another wants more space.





            * Figure out whether it's a difficult-but-healable relationship, or one that you should walk away from.





            * Talk to friends and family about your RA and/or polyamorous relationships.





            * ALWAYS stay true to yourself!!!

Based on 40 years of relationship research, the Gottman approach takes the guess-work out of how we can cultivate strong & lasting relationships. When working to increase sexual & emotional intimacy, I practice Imago Relationship Therapy. \n\n\n\n\n\nI use Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT or \"Tapping\") to help clients reduce stress, panic and anxiety. Tapping is a confluence of mindfulness, self-compassion, exposure therapy, and accessing the body's ability to down-regulate our stress response through acupuncture points. Tapping is also highly effective in healing traumatic experiences and desensitizing both context specific & interpersonal triggers. You can learn more about Tapping in this Ted Talk & Research Article.\n\n\n\n\n\nFolks are getting hurt by the misuse of faith-based power.

        description: "I provide therapeutic treatment for individuals, couples, and groups facing seeming impasses and resulting physical and emotional symptoms. I have specialized training in trauma and work with survivors, to uncover missed experiences and process traumatic happenings that may have previously left an imprint within the nervous system. With couples managing trauma, we look for new ways to improve capacities to maintain regulation and find ease in the relationship. In therapy we will collaboratively honor the lengths taken to survive our experiences and work to pave a path to thriving.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy approach is mindful and dialogic. I encourage exploration and have a knack for helping smart people move passed self-limiting thoughts and behaviours. As a practicing Buddhist and a yogi there is a transpersonal bend to the space I hold, but I do not push nor promote any schools of thought. I pride myself on upholding a level of cultural competence I feel necessary to facilitate change in community and growth in therapy. My practice is open, accepting, poly-versed, kink aware, and LGBTQIA+ affirming. \n\n\n\n\n\nAs a somatic clinician, I am sensitive not only to the cultural influences in our bones, but to the unique neurobiological and psychosocial makeup that is you. Therapy with me is gentle yet rigorous. I work at your pace yet hold in mind always treatment goals brought to me and my responsibility to you as a helping other. With whole systems care at heart, I have a holistic approach to wellness. In session I draw upon traditional psychodynamic and eastern philosophies and practices as well as current somatic science and contemporary treatment modalities such as: Somatic Experiencing, Polyvagal Theory, Fusion Acupressure, Formative Psychology, Yoga Therapeutics, Hakomi, AEDP, EFT, and PACT. You can find a broader account of my approach, style, and modalities I utilize on my site www.somaticcentered.com."

        description: "I provide therapeutic treatment for individuals, couples, and groups facing seeming impasses and resulting physical and emotional symptoms. I have specialized training in trauma and work with survivors, to uncover missed experiences and process traumatic happenings that may have previously left an imprint within the nervous system. With couples managing trauma, we look for new ways to improve capacities to maintain regulation and find ease in the relationship. In therapy we will collaboratively honor the lengths taken to survive our experiences and work to pave a path to thriving.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy approach is mindful and dialogic. I encourage exploration and have a knack for helping smart people move passed self-limiting thoughts and behaviours. As a practicing Buddhist and a yogi there is a transpersonal bend to the space I hold, but I do not push nor promote any schools of thought. I pride myself on upholding a level of cultural competence I feel necessary to facilitate change in community and growth in therapy. My practice is open, accepting, poly-versed, kink aware, and LGBTQIA+ affirming. \n\n\n\n\n\nAs a somatic clinician, I am sensitive not only to the cultural influences in our bones, but to the unique neurobiological and psychosocial makeup that is you. Therapy with me is gentle yet rigorous. I work at your pace yet hold in mind always treatment goals brought to me and my responsibility to you as a helping other. With whole systems care at heart, I have a holistic approach to wellness. In session I draw upon traditional psychodynamic and eastern philosophies and practices as well as current somatic science and contemporary treatment modalities such as: Somatic Experiencing, Polyvagal Theory, Fusion Acupressure, Formative Psychology, Yoga Therapeutics, Hakomi, AEDP, EFT, and PACT. You can find a broader account of my approach, style, and modalities I utilize on my site www.somaticcentered.com."

            I studied counseling because I wanted to help others maintain their mental wellness and regain their mental health during difficult times. I view mental health as a normal part of life. As such you don't have to seek my services only when you are struggling. You could come to counseling to discuss issues, feelings, and matters of your everyday life or to organize your ideas or gain clarity about your life or aspects of your life. You can also come to therapy because you are struggling with anxiety or adjusting to a new dynamic or event in your life.





            I can help immigrants who are adapting to living in a new culture and are struggling being away from home and adjusting to a new culture. I also enjoy working with teens and their families. I offer support to clients that are experiencing grief. Lastly, I work with individuals and couples who are living or exploring polyamory/consensual non-monogamy.





            I look forward to collaborating with you in your journey of mental wellness!!!





            Counseling can be offered in English or Spanish. I am currently only seeing telehealth clients in the state of Ohio.  I do not accept insurance.  I offer reduce prices through: https://openpathcollective.org/
