I believe the more intimately connected we are to our own feelings, needs, desires and strengths; the better able we are to experience this in all areas of life.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matter how we may \"label\" ourselves sexually, ethnically, by gender, age, or current life challenges, we all basically desire a life filled with love, purpose, meaning and increased connection with others.  I am dedicated in helping you gain this for yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit my website for further information.","categories":"Psychotherapists - Licensed","location":"US-CA (California)","countries":"US","regions":"CA","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
