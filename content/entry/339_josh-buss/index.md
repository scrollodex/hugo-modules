This is especially important in a culture that is still too often rejecting of LGBTQIA+ people. My training includes supervision focused on working in an affirming way with LGBTQIA+ people and I am committed to an ongoing process of understanding the unique needs of those whose sexuality and/or gender identity does not conform to \"mainstream\" society. I am a member of the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom (NCSF) and adhere to the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care and the American Counseling Association (ACA) Competencies for Counseling LGBTQ+ Individuals.
