I use a Task Centered\nApproach to treatment and begin by listening carefully and setting goals\nfor each client and our work together.\n\n\n\n\nIn my view, the concerns people bring to therapy are often not a matter\nof illness, but part of a clients quest for greater wholeness and\ngratification in life. I believe that the human psyche has the ability to\nheal itself and that I can help individuals facilitate the healing\nprocess. I further believe that therapy needs to be a good fit between\ntherapist and client. I offer a comfortable, safe and confidential\nenvironment where clients can better cope with their personal issues,\nbecome more self aware and gain a better understanding of their\ninteractions with the people in their past, present and future.
