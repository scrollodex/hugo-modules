I treat sexual difficulties or lifestyle issues from a sex positive perspective. I also work with those who have culturally unpopular or unsupported life styles, and who experience conflict, marginalization, or disempowerment.  I work with people who wish to make changes in their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. I use hypnosis, cognitive therapy, and psychoanalytic psychotherapy for making significant life changes.  My work is within the spirit and contexts of various liberation movements which strive to further the development, fulfillment, and affirmation of human creativity and potential, optimizing a persons development in light of changing life philosophies or values.","categories":"Psychotherapists - Licensed","location":"US-OR (Oregon)","countries":"US","regions":"OR","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
