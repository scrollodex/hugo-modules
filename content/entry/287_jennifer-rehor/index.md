I am caring, non-judgmental, and empathetic, and my approach to therapy is collaborative - my role is to be a catalyst for the change you desire. I help individuals with anxiety, depression, life transitions, and personal growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor couples/relationship therapy, I have been trained in and use the framework of Emotionally Focused Therapy. This type of therapy is geared toward the importance of your attachment bonds with each other, recognizing the negative cycles where couples often get stuck, and learning how to change the way you relate to each other in a deeper and more meaningful way. To better understand this therapeutic approach, please visit: http://www.iceeft.com/index.php/about-us/what-is-eft. I work within this framework for clients from a variety of relationship dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am very familiar with the diversity of lifestyle and relationships found today. With my background in the field of sexology, I enjoy working with people who have issues or concerns about sexual health and people who want to increase their level of intimacy and sexual satisfaction. I provide a safe space to discuss delicate topics and my goal is to make each of my clients feel comfortable and understood.&#8232;\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about me and my practice, please visit www.JenniferRehor.com.","categories":"Psychotherapists - Licensed","location":"US-CA (California)","countries":"US","regions":"CA","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
