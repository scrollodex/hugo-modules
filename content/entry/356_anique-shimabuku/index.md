Much of my experience is working with people of color and queer and trans/gender non-conforming people. I have extensive training in trauma practice, particularly around experiences of abuse, violence, and intergenerational trauma. I draw from a variety of therapeutic techniques, including psychodynamic therapy, Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, Internal Family Systems, mindfulness, and other relational and somatic approaches. I am a queer, mixed-race Asian American of Uchinanchu and Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and my therapy space is warm and collaborative, fostering individuals' ability to build resilience, joy, and power.","categories":"Psychotherapists - Licensed","location":"US-NY (New York)","countries":"US","regions":"NY","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
