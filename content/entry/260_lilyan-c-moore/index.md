I am a member of the Association for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender Issues in Counseling.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am sensitive to the needs of bisexual clients and understand that they often face erasure and invalidation in both the heterosexual and the LGB community. My practice is client-centered, and I invite clients to work through their problems in a safe, affirmative space. I work with individuals, couples, partners, and families. I am poly and kink aware.
