I work with a wide range of\ncommunities including those in intentional spiritual communities or\npractices, those identifying as polyamorous (loving more than one, openly\n& honestly) and those with BDSM/leather affinities.  My sex coaching\nservices -- patterned after Dodson (<a href=\"http://www.bettydodson.com\">www.bettydodson.com</a>) and Kramer (<a href=\"http://www.erospirit.org\">www.erospirit.org</a>) -- help you improve your self-pleasuring capacity and\nuse that capacity to empower your whole life.\n\n\n\n  \n\nI also offer a variety of speechs and workshops (see website) and am available for guest teaching\nand guest lecturing.  My self-published doctoral dissertation on\ncontempoary U.S. sacred sexualities is available through my website,\nwhich also includes other samples of my writings, including the\nmuch-beloved 1991 anthology, Bi Any Other Name: Bisexual People Speak\nOut, named one of the top 100 queer books of the last century, which I\nco-edited with Lani Ka-ahumanu.","categories":"Psychotherapists - Unlicensed","location":"US-MD (Maryland)","countries":"US","regions":"MD","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
