You may feel rejected or misunderstood by many different groups, or you may have been the subject of stereotypes and judgments about your sexuality. Like any other form of discrimination, these experiences can lead to feelings of alienation, invisibility, and lowered self-worth, which have a particularly negative impact on mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy approach is to hold a safe space for you to be seen and heard. Together, our work may include increasing self-esteem and self-empowerment, dialoguing with the inner critic, who may be holding negative self-beliefs, and coping with the outer critics - the people around you who do not seem to understand.\n\n\n\n\n\nI specialize in somatic psychotherapy, which is an effective approach to working with depression, anxiety, trauma and PTSD. I also have experience working with intimate relationships, communication problems, life transitions, adjusting to change, and finding life meaning and purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease visit my web site to learn more about me: http://www.kerrigreentherapy.com.","categories":"Psychotherapists - Licensed","location":"US-CA (California)","countries":"US","regions":"CA","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
