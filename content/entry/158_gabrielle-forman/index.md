I have\nextensive experience in increasing peoples ability to regulate moods and\nemotions; decrease co-dependent behaviors with family of origin or romantic\npartners; and increase self-efficacy.  I have a long history of working with\nlesbian, bisexual and questioning women, and expertise in helping clients\ncome out or deal with the oppression that can occur when interfacing with a\nheterocentric/sexist society.   While not every client will have a need to\ndiscuss their orientation, every client deserves a therapist who is\ncompletely accepting and affirmative of their orientation.","categories":"Psychotherapists - Licensed","location":"US-CA (California)","countries":"US","regions":"CA","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
