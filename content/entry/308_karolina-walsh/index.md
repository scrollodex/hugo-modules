I am also trained in Applied Existential Psychotherapy which centers on Gestalt work and choice as a vital part of personal work and psychotherapy. I write a blog which I publish on my website that is a good sampling of my work and orientation. I am also queer and genderqueer which is one of the populations I work with. I have bisexual clients and see them needing more resources to embody their sexual identity and enjoy being that for them.","categories":"Psychotherapists - Licensed","location":"US-CO (Colorado)","countries":"US","regions":"CO","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
