For 15 years, bisexuality and consensual non-monogamy have been the structure, identity and study of my own relationships.  The intersections of our marginalized identities are valid and crucial to connecting more authentically with others. Let me empower you to gain a more intuitive understanding of yourself and your desires so that you can stand alone with confidence in your identity while also feeling the support of communities in which you belong. With practical interventions I can help move you towards creating more authentic connections. \n\n\n\n\n\nFree 20 min phone consultation.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish, American Sign Language (ASL)\n\n\n\n\n\nApproach: Motivational Interviewing, Solution Focused and Non-Violent Communication\n\n\n\n\n\nOffering services to individuals who are:\n\n\n* Bisexual, Pansexual, Queer, LGBTQIA\n\n\n\n\n\n* Consensual Non-Monogamy (CNM), Polyamory\n\n\n\n\n\n* Deaf & Hard of Hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n* In Transitions\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecializations:\n\n\n* Gender expansive language\n\n\n\n\n\n* Coming Out\n\n\n\n\n\n* Kink-positive\n\n\n\n\n\n* Disability\n\n\n\n\n\n* Parenting","categories":"Psychotherapists - Unlicensed","location":"US-CA (California)","countries":"US","regions":"CA","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
