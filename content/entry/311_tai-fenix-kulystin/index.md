I find my clients come to me because something has changed in the way they are relating to themselves, their lover(s), and/or the world. Something feels off, and my clients are looking for support and guidance to a greater depth of experience and a more whole version of themselves and their sex/life!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy approach is based on my Master's degree in Sacred Erotic Psychology, certifications in Sexological Bodywork, Clinical Trauma Professional, and Transpersonal Hypnotherapy, as well as numerous hours of work with clients and with myself. I have extensive knowledge of and personal experience with truma, kink/bdsm, polyamory/non-monogamy, queer/lgbp+ and trans/non-binary experiences, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nSessions are a blend of therapeutic talking/mind-based interaction, body-based/embodiment exercises, and/or educational-therapeutic touch. The session experience is completely dependent upon your goals, and focused on increasing your experience of embodiment and intimacy with yourself, others, and the world.","categories":"Psychotherapists - Licensed","location":"US-WA (Washington)","countries":"US","regions":"WA","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
