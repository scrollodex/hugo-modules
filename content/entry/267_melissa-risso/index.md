As the voted San Francisco Bay Area American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors & Therapists (AASECT) leader, I am extremely active in promoting positive sexual health in various Bay Area communities. Within these communities there are members that identify as bisexual, gay, lesbian, transgendered, kink & BDSM friendly, swingers, cisgendered and polyamorous.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my work, I constantly strive to grow and learn as a therapist in order to provide the best opportunities to my clients and the communities in which I serve. These include reading various articles in the field of sexual health and bisexuality, attending on-going trainings and workshops held by SSTAR, AASECT, Good Vibrations and other well-known sexual health organizations, and working with clients that identify as bisexual. Some of my areas of focus include kink, BDSM, polyamory, high-low desire, pornography, grief & loss, infidelity, self-esteem, career counseling, and overall relationship counseling. \nAdditionally, I have a podcast called Lets Do It With Melissa Risso which focuses on promoting healthy conversations around both mental and sexual health.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith patience and persistence, my clients cultivate greater confidence and self-esteem, richer relationships, and more emotional balance and health. I believe that we all need someone to talk with who will listen and accept us as we are, without judgment. Because of this, I provide my clients with a warm, nonjudgmental environment- a safe place to explore the issues that may be preventing people from living the life they want.","categories":"Psychotherapists - Licensed","location":"US-CA (California)","countries":"US","regions":"CA","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
