I also supervise trainees at Queer LifeSpace, a nonprofit providing low-fee mental health and substance abuse services to the LGBTQQI communities. My office is centrally located in the Mission District of San Francisco, where I offer individual psychotherapy for adults.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy specific areas of interest and expertise are:\n\n\n\n\n\nAlcohol and Substance Use Concerns\n\n\nHarm Reduction and Motivational Interviewing Techniques\n\n\nDepression, Anxiety, and Mood Disorders\n\n\nRecovery from Trauma and Loss\n\n\nSocial Justice Conversations\n\n\nHabit Change and Goal-Setting\n\n\nEmployment and Career Consultation\n\n\nExploring Identity\n\n\nAnger Management and Conflict Resolution\n\n\n\n\n\nI welcome all to my practice, and am particularly interested in inviting those who may not feel as comfortable in all treatment spaces: members of the LGBTQQIAAP communities, gender-creative folks, people wanting to talk about size acceptance, people of color and members of marginalized groups, those in non-traditional relationships (polyamory, kink/BDSM), iconoclastic artists and activists, Burners and nerds, and everyone else who struggles with how to succeed on this planet without forcing themselves to fit in.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy rate is $150. I am currently an in-network provider for Cigna Behavioral Health, and am in process with other insurance plans. If I am not on your plan, I can provide invoices you may submit for reimbursement. Free initial telephone consultation.","categories":"Psychotherapists - Licensed","location":"US-CA (California)","countries":"US","regions":"CA","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
