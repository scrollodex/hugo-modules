Specialisations; sexuality, gender, abuse, trauma, depression, anxiety and relationship issues.

Knowing that this is an aspect of your life that I will not automatically pathologise often provides a strong and creative start to working together.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional experience that informs my practice includes life coaching, mentoring, cognitive behavioural hypnotherapy and N.L.P. Rich background of Consulting, Presenting and Facilitating extensive classes, workshops, groups and talks e.g. at five UK Universities and for national events/organisations such as (keynote speaker at) the Pink Therapy Conference, SMPride, Kinkfest 2004 (Organising Director), Polyday, Tantra4GayMen, Unitarian Youth Workers Training Conference.
