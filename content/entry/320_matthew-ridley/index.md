My practice is LGBTQ+ positive, sex-positive and poly-positive. I am sensitive to the politics of gender identity and sexual orientation, including those that people who identify as bisexual might experience, and the ways in which these politics may inform our experience of self and of our relationships. I work from a perspective of honouring and connecting to our values, strengths and preferences as a way of moving through times of personal and relationship struggle.","categories":"Psychotherapists - Licensed","location":"CA-BC (British Columbia)","countries":"CA","regions":"BC","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
