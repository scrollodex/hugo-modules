What are some specific concerns that bisexuals face? How can a counselor take these issues into account so as to be supportive to their bisexual clients?\n\n\n\n\n\n**What Psychology Professionals Should Know About Polyamory: The Lifestyles and Mental Health Concerns of Polyamorous Individuals.**\n\n\n\n\nPolyamory is a lifestyle in which romantic partners agree that they may each have romantic relationships with other people as well. It is distinguished from infidelity by the presence of honest, supportive communication between partners and lovers about the existence of each of these relationships in their lives. This workshop talks about some of the unique concerns that polyamorous people face, and the ways in which a therapist can be supportive of and helpful to their polyamorous clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n**What Therapists Should Know About Working with Clients Who Are Members of the BDSM Community**\n\n\n\n\nAbout 5-10 percent of the US population practices some variety of bdsm play, but most therapists do not have an understanding of what this means in their clients lives, nor how to distinguish between BDSM and abuse. This lecture aims to address some of the common misperceptions about BDSM, and suggest ways in which a therapist can be supportive of and helpful to their BDSM community clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Workshop/Lecture Fees:**\n\n\n\n\n\nI charge $200 per hour of presentation time, plus travel and lodging expenses if the lecture is outside of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n\n\n \n\n**More about me:**\n\n\n\n\nI am an openly bisexual psychologist, practicing in Los Altos, CA. I have experience working within the Bisexual, Lesbian, Gay, Polyamory, Kink/BDSM, HIV+/POZ, and DD communities. My other specialties include relationship work, career counseling, managing depression, anxiety, anger, substance and internet addictions, codependency, and self-acceptance.
