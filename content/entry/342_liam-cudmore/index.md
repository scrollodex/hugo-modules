I am affirming of queer and TGNC identities, kink and D/S lifestyle relationships, sex work, and polyamory/consensual non-monogamy. As a feminist transman, my work is informed by intersectionality and motivated by personal experience with the communities I serve. You'll find me warm and down to earth, with a strength-based approach that centers your priorities. I seek to support and empower you, as we explore your identities, relationships, and goals, in an affirming environment. I employ a variety of therapeutic modalities, including psychodynamic, CBT, and DBT, to meet your individual needs.","categories":"Psychotherapists - Licensed","location":"US-NY (New York)","countries":"US","regions":"NY","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
