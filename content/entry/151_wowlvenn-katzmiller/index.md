We explore the spoken and unspoken dynamics of intimacy and boundaries with self and others, of parent-child bonding, and of navigating conflicts, wounding, and trauma past or present. I also work with addictions. My approach is holistic, body-oriented, offers use of expressive arts, and celebrates diversity, particularly of sexual orientation and partnering styles, gender, and spirituality.\n\n\n\n\n\nI consider therapy a collaborative process, so I work best with clients who have a sense of what troubles them and at least a vague vision for the differences they want. That is where I come in.\n\n\n\n\n\nI will use my skills to help you identify what specifically is not working for you in your life, develop a vision for the way you wish things were instead, and then narrow that gap. I will follow your lead in setting goals together for the therapy while also utilizing my professional perspectives and experience. My intention is to support an integrated dynamic within your body, mind, emotions, spirit, relationships with others, and with your unique conception of the world in which you live.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we will probably explore your past experiences, our focus will be on your present experiences and your hopes and desires for your future.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have offered professional trainings on Poly Parenting Issues, Self-Care, and Expressive Arts Therapy Techniques, and am in progress on a Poly-Aware Professionals Clinical Handboook.","categories":"Psychotherapists - Licensed","location":"US-CA (California)","countries":"US","regions":"CA","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
