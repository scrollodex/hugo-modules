Feeling isolated can be particularly poignant for bisexual people. I have worked with clients from diverse racial and ethnic groups, from various socioeconomic circumstances, of different ages and sexual and gender identities. I provide affirming support while challenging clients to identify obstacles to the realization of their potential. My office is conveniently located in Union Square; I offer affordable fees and a sliding scale application for clients in need.\n\n\n\n\n\nI specialize in working with clients who identify as transgender, HIV+ or bisexual, those involved in BDSM, kinky, or polyamorous relationships, and any clients struggling with depression, anxiety, or life adjustments (aging, career change, bereavement). I have experience working with same sex and serodiscordant couples. I appreciate working with clients who have a desire to achieve or maintain recovery from addiction to substances, sex, pornography, or codependent relationships, as I have personal experience with recovery. I believe that each of us has the capacity to change and that altering patterns of self-destructive behavior enables us to create lives that are more free and fulfilling.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a researcher, I have given presentations and workshops at the New York Mental Health Counselors Association, American Psychological Association, Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality, Philadelphia Trans Health Conference, Southeastern Regional Counseling Psychology conference, the Institute for Human Identity, and the State Society on Aging of New York. I am a hotline volunteer for the New York Anti-Violence Project, a former peer counselor for Identity House, and a former counseling intern at Iris House, a community center seving people living with HIV/AIDS.","categories":"Psychotherapists - Licensed","location":"US-NY (New York)","countries":"US","regions":"NY","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
