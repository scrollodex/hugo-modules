My professional and personal coaching services are unique and different than most practicing professionals in that it incorporates various mainstream clinical best practices like Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, with depth psychological approaches to understanding conscious and unconscious forces contributing to long held and frustrating patterns.  At its detriment, modern training and practice of counseling and therapy primarily focus on behavioral changes, which are minimally impactful and do not address long term, unresolved core psychological issues.  These unresolved issues present themselves as sexual dysfunctions, psychiatric illness, maladaptive behaviors or substance abuse/dependence which impede or block healthy professional and personal growth and development.  Core psychological issues involve, in part, male and feminine energy; sexual and non-sexual power dynamics; as well as the \"shadow\" aspect of the unconscious self, which drives uncontrollable (conscious & unconscious) desires and ineffective redundant behaviors.  It is because of this and other limitations; traditional counseling and therapy results in short lived success, increased frustration and the eroding of hope each time the individual or couple returns for additional treatment.  Like professional consultations, educational seminars and trainings, psychotherapy and sex therapy sessions are dynamic and tailored to the clients specific needs and goals.\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonally, I identify, in part, as bisexual/Queer man.","categories":"Psychotherapists - Licensed","location":"US-VA (Virginia)","countries":"US","regions":"VA","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
