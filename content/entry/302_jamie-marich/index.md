Most importantly, I am an out-and-proud bisexual with a great passion for letting the world know that we do exist and that many of us are out there leading healthy and full lives! My primary specialties are trauma, addiction, mindfulness, and expressive arts therapy, approaches that I bring to my work with LGBT+ clients. I welcome you however you identify, and know that I do bring an understanding to the specific needs of bisexual/pansexual clients who practice their sexual expression in a variety of ways. In 2015, I was honored with the President's Award by NALGAP: The Association of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Addiction Professionals and Their Allies.
