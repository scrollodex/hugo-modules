For some, it is refreshing and welcoming and facilitates exploration of the self. For others, this approach is unfamiliar and perhaps even distinctly different from past therapeutic relationships. I work with a variety of adults ranging in age, gender, experience, race, sexuality, spiritual path, relationship structure, and family dynamics.","categories":"Psychotherapists - Licensed","location":"US-CO (Colorado)","countries":"US","regions":"CO","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
