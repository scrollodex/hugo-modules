I also treat sexual problems and concerns and have training in sex therapy. I work with clients ages 12 and up, and treat couples and families as well as individuals. I offer therapy groups for adolescents and young adults including LGBTQ-spectrum groups. I am sex-positive and queer-affirmative. I understand that while identity issues may be a focus of therapy, in other cases, a client may simply seek a therapist who understands their identity so that they can safety and comfortably talk about whatever else may be of concern.","categories":"Psychotherapists - Licensed","location":"US-NJ (New Jersey)","countries":"US","regions":"NJ","lastUpdate":"1899-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":"entry"}
