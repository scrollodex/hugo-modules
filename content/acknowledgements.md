# Acknowledgements and Links

I would like to thank the following people and organizations who helped tremendously with the creation of this website:

- The creators of the [Kink Aware Professionals List](http://www.bannon.com/kap/) and [Poly Friendly Professionals List](http://www.polychromatic.com/pfp/), which provided the inspiration for this site.
- The members of [BiZone.org](http://www.bizone.org/), who provided a host site for this directory.
- [Tom Limoncelli](http://whatexit.org/tal/), bi activist and old friend, who provided advice and technical assistance on numerous aspects of the project.
- Emmett Pickerel, partner extraordinaire, who set up the database for the site.
- The many [bisexuality-aware professionals](https://www.bizone.org/bap/locate.html) who provide services to our community and who agreed to be listed in this directory.
 
Thanks very much to all of these folks!
