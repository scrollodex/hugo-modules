## Why seek a Bisexuality-Aware Professional?

Bisexuals are often inaccurately perceived as a subcategory of the gay and lesbian community, when in fact we have different social, legal and health concerns. Bisexuality-Aware Professionals are knowledgeable about these concerns, and they provide services which take bisexual folks' particular needs into account.

Bisexuals sometimes face discrimination within the gay, lesbian and straight communities, and it can be important to work with a professional who is friendly and welcoming towards bisexual clientele.

## What qualifies a professional as "Bisexuality-Aware?"

The professionals who have chosen to list themselves in this directory have all stated to the directory coordinator that they meet at least 3 of the following criteria for bisexuality-awareness:

- Believes that bisexuality is a valid lifestyle and is welcoming towards bisexual people
- Knows of several ways in which bisexuals' concerns differ from gays' and lesbians' concerns
- Is an active participant in bisexual community events or forums

- Has attended a professional workshop on the concerns of bisexual people
- Has worked professionally with several bisexual clientele in the past
- Has organized bisexually oriented support or social groups or workshops
- Has given lectures on bisexuality
- Has written articles or books on bisexuality

## Are all of the professionals listed here bisexual themselves?

Some are, some aren't. It is not necessary to identify as bisexual to possess an awareness of the concerns and needs of the bisexual community.
